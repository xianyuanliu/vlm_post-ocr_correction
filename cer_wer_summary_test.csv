3200797034,"SERVANTS AND THEIR SWEETHEARTS. ON Saturday, at the Croydon petty sessions, Percy Davis, alias Gordon, a clerk, and Robert Everett, alias Davenport (two fashionably-attired young men, of 47 Auckland-road, Vauxhall), and Elizabeth Williams described as a general servant, were charged on remand with being concerned together in stealing from the dwelling-house, 3 Prior-terrace, St. James’s road, Croydon, since October 1881, two gold chains, two diamond rings, two cameo brooches, two gold seals, three gold pins, some silver forks and spoons, and about £20 in silver money, the property of Mary Ann Cosens, valued altogether at about £50; and Robert Everett, father of the prisoner of that name, was charged with receiving the property well knowing it to have been stolen, and he was further charged with unlawfully pledging the same. The last-named prisoner was for some years a superintendent in the Dorsetshire constabulary. Mr. Young, who appeared for the prosecution, said that his client, Mrs. Cosens, was an invalid lady eighty-two years of age, and quite unable to attend the court owing to her infirmity. In September last she engaged the female prisoner as a confidential servant and attendant, and she was the only person who had access to the jewellery. Short after entering Mrs. Cosens’ service she formed the acquaintance of the prisoner Davis, and at the time under the pretence of paying his addresses to the girl, he gained admission to the house, and there was no doubt that he had made the place his home. He had evidently slept on the premises, and enticed the girl to steal her mistress’s jewellery, which he took away and pledged, and spent the proceeds about the town; Everett shortly afterwards came upon the scene, and carried out the same kind of proceeding, Emily Barlow, cook to the prosecutrix, stated that the prisoners first came to the house in soldiers’ clothes, which they afterwards exchanged for civilian dresses. They used to get up to breakfast about half-past eleven o’clock in the morning, and helped themselves to dinner, the witness cooking the meat purchased out of her mistress’s money. Davis was apparently courting Williams, and a servant named Smith, aged twenty-three used to visit the house on two evenings in the week, and keep company with Everett. During the courtship she also slept in the house. Witness was not aware of the jewellery having been stolen. Detective Forster was then called to prove the arrest of the elder Everett. The accused said: - “My son gave me the things to pledge, as I was better known, and could get more money. He told me that the articles had been given to him by a relative.” The case was adjourned, and the prisoners were removed to the House of Detention.","SERVANTS AND THEIR SWEETHEARTS. .

3200801615,"SHOT FIRING IN MINES. AN important case came on at the Gateshead County Police-court on Saturday, proceedings having been taken by the Home Office against the manager of the Usworth Colliery, for illegal shot-firing on March 2nd, the day on which the disastrous explosion, by which forty-two lives were lost, occurred at that colliery. The summons was issued against Mr. A. S. Palmer, who was present, as agent of the colliery. Mr. Arnold Morley, M.P., presented on behalf the Crown, and Mr. R. F. Cooper, Newcastle, appeared for the owners. Mr. Morley said the prosecution was taken under 35 and 36 Vic., chap. 76, of the Mines Regulation Act. With regard to the use of gunpowder, it was provided that it should only be used in cartridges, and not within three months after any inflammable gas had been found in the mine. The prosecution relied in this case of the fact that inflammable gas had been found in the mine within three months of the firing of the shot, and the question was whether the regulation had been complied with, it being requisite under the Act for some competent person duly appointed for that purpose to examine the place where the shot was to be fired immediately before the firing, and not to allow it to be discharged except it was safe to do so. It was also provided that persons ordinarily employed in the mine were to be out of it or that part of it where the explosive was to be used. Mr. Cooper said he did not dispute that gas had been found, but it was not found within the conditions of the Act. He was prepared to prove that it was due to a temporary stoppage in the ordinary ventilation appliances, and was removed when the ventilation was put right. After evidence had been given on both sides, it was agreed between Mr. Morley and Mr. Cooper that the question at issue was really a legal one as to the meaning of the Act with regard to the conditions under which shot-firing should not take place. The Court was, therefore, asked not to give its decision, but to adjourn the case until the legal question had been referred to a superior court.

3200801630,"THE QUEEN V. LEGG. QUEEN’S BENCH DIVISION. – (Before Lord Coleridge and Mrs. Justice Mathew.) – In this case a rule had been granted for a certiorari to remove an indictment for libel preferred against George Francis Legg, a solicitor, on the prosecution of Harold Alexander, an officer in her Majesty’s army, from the Central Criminal Court to this Court, in order that it might be tried before a special jury. The circumstances were as follow: Both the defendant and prosecutor are members of the Cocoa Tree Club, in St. James’-street, Piccadilly, and on the 8th of December, 1884, they played at cards there the result being that Mr. Alexander won £1,760 from Mr. Legg, who, as he was losing, said he would only lose £500, which he was ready at once to pay, provided that any sum exceeding that amount should be played for on a future evening. They subsequently played a few games, when Mr. Alexander won an additional £200, and the defendant paid him £500, the balance standing over. A few weeks afterwards Mr. Legg, according to his affidavit, heard that Mr. Alexander had been accused of cheating a Mr. Wyndham of £550 at cards, at the Road Club, in January, 1885, and on the 18th of February the defendant wrote a letter to the committee of the Cocoa Tree Club to the effect that Mr. Harold Alexander had been compelled to resign his membership of the Road Club, having been detected at cheating at cards, and that he was prepared to prove this charge. This was the libel complained of, and for which he was committed for trial, but was allowed to stand out on his own recognisances of £50. The matter now came before this court on an application by Mr. Matthews, which was opposed by Mr. Gill, to expedite the hearing of the rule for the certiorari, in order that the trial might take place before the prosecutor had to rejoin his regiment in India. The Court, disapproving of the course taken by the prosecutor in instituting criminal proceedings in the case of a private squabble, refused the application with costs. ______________________________ AT the Hull Police-court, on Thursday, a young girl named Isabella Hewson was charged with the murder of her illegitimate child by hanging it. On her brother being called she became terribly excited, shrieked out the name of her child, and went into several fits.

AT the West Bromwich Police-court, on Saturday, John Taylor, of Handsworth, was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for embezzling money belonging to Messrs. Warden and Co., trading as the Phoenix Nut and Bolt Company, in whose employ he was as assistant warehouseman.

ON Saturday morning, about six o’clock, a platelayer named David Hayden, of Shortlands, in the employ of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway company was knocked down and killed by the Dover express near Beckenham Junction Station. It appears that the deceased was going to his work, walking up the line between or near the up rails. This is contrary to the custom, because in such a position he was in the way of trains approaching from behind, which he would be less likely to notice than those approaching from the front. The driver pulled up after the accident and gave information at Beckenham Station, and the deceased was found lying unconscious but not actually dead on the line, his head bearing unmistakable evidence that it had been struck by the engine. He died on the way to St. George’s Hospital. _______________________________ A PROMINENT speaker at a free trader’s meeting at Madrid, on Monday, stated that there are in Spain more than a million and a half male adults occupied in different industries and liberal professions, and these, with the exception of some 59,000 Catalans, are eager for free trade; while of these Catalans 54,000 are from Barcelona.

Prisoner was put outside, but afterwards came into the bar in which witness was. The prisoner made some remarks to him and struck him on the cheek. He closed with the man and got him on the ground, and in the struggle the prisoner bit his hand. A constable was fetched and the prisoner was given in charge.

ON Monday, at the Bow-street Police-court, James Foley was charged with assault. Thomas Ronwick, of Queen-street, Long Acre, said that on Saturday night at about twelve o’clock he was standing at his door when he saw the prisoner come up behind and old man, jump on his back, knock him down, and hit him. The person assaulted was in witness’s employ. A police-man was sent for, and witness held the prisoner till he arrived. While he was detaining the man he struck him in the eye, and kicked at him. The prisoner had just come out of the Clock House public house, where it was said that he had twisted a woman’s nose and broken it. The prisoner stated that if he was locked up he would put a knife into the prosecutor when he came out, and would be hanged for him. A constable said that he saw the prisoner assault Mr. Ronwick. The accused had been several times convicted, and was now sentenced to two months’ imprisonment for the assault, and afterwards to find a surety in £10 to be of good behaviour for eight months.","KILLED BY THE DOVER EXPRESS.

On Saturday morning, about six o'clock, a platelayer named David Hayden, of Shortlands, in the employ of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company was knocked down and killed by the Dover express near Beckenham Junction Station. It appears that the deceased was going to his work, walking up the line between or near the up rails. This is contrary to the custom, because in such a position he was in the way of trains approaching from behind, which he would be less likely to notice than those approaching from the front. The driver pulled up after the accident and gave information at Beckenham Station, and the deceased was found lying unconscious but not actually dead on the line, his head bearing unmistakable evidence that it had been struck by the engine. He died on the way to St. George's Hospital. A PROMINENT speaker at a free traders' meeting at Madrid, on Monday, stated that there are in Spain more than a million and a half male adults occupied in different industries and liberal professions, and these, with the exception of some 59,000 Catalans, are eager for free trade; while of these Catalans 54,000 are from Barcelona. At the Bow-street Police-court, on Monday, John Mahony was charged with assault. John Donally, of New Temple-buildings, said that about seven o'clock on Saturday evening he was sitting in a bar in the Black Horse public-house in Bedfordbury, when he saw the prisoner being ejected from one of the compartments. Prisoner was put outside, but afterwards came into the bar in which witness was. The prisoner made some remarks to him and struck him on the cheek. He closed with the man and got him on the ground, and in the struggle the prisoner bit his hand. A constable was fetched and the prisoner was given in charge. Sergeant White, the gaoler, said that the prisoner belonged to a very bad gang of men, and had been charged several times. Prisoner was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment. On Monday, at the Bow-street Police-court, James Foley was charged with assault.

3200807900,"SINGULAR ACTION FOR SLANDER. I the Sheriff’s Court for the County of London, last week, the case of Mary Blaver Bennett (a married woman, suing in respect of a separate estate) v. James Beneys—it being an action for slander—came on for assessment of damages, Before Mr. Under-Sheriff Burchell and a jury. Mr. Harper, barrister, appeared for the plaintiff, who resides at 6, Waterloo-place, Bromell’s-buildings, Clapham; and the defendant, who appeared in person, is a painter, residing in the same neighborhood. Mr. Harper, in opening the case, declared that the language complained of was of the very worst character. What the defendant said to the plaintiff was, “You are a thief, and you have robbed me of £3.” That was a specific charge, in specific language, but the defendant had not appeared to support it, and judgment had been given against him by default. But this accusation was not all the defendant said of the plaintiff. He also said, “You keep nothing but a house of ill-fame,” and he even accused her of encouraging his daughters at her house. It was true that the defendant’s daughters did visit the plaintiffs house, but the explanation of that was that, when the mother of the girls died, she commended them on her dead bed to the care of her friend, the plaintiff. Mary Bennett, the plaintiff, was called, and stated that she had known the defendant as a neighbour for twelve years, and had been a friend of his wife and children. On May 17th last she met the defendant, and asked to speak to him, but before she could open her mouth he made use of the language complained of. Up to that time she never had any quarrel with him. As a result of his charges she had suffered very much in the eyes of her neighbours. She had been hooted at and pointed at as the woman who took the man’s daughters away. The defendant went into the box and repeated his assertions, but called no witnesses. He asserted that he had been cruelly treated, and accused plaintiff of making certain assertions with respect to his relations with his late wife. At last the Under-Sheriff interfered in a particularly vehement speech, with the remark, “Really, gentleman, the court is being turned into a chamber of horrors.” The jury eventually found a verdict of £3. Defendant: I have no money. The Under-Sheriff: I can’t help that. The law must take its course.","SINGULAR ACTION FOR SLANDER.

Mr. James Branch, boot manufacturer, a member of the London County Council, and a deacon of the church in question, said that from the description he had from his minister, he watched this child in church on Sunday evening. She was sitting in one of the pews, and from what he saw he felt impressed. that she was— Mr. Romain: Never mind your impressions. Witness (continuing) said that at the close of the service the child sat in the seat some time after she might have gone, subsequently stood at the end of the pew, and then mixed with ladies as they came down the aisle. Witness followed behind, and saw her moving her hands in a very suspicious manner amongst the ladies' dresses. Witness followed her to the church porch, and then thought it best to take her. He noticed that she had her gloves on during the service, but now she had the glove off her right hand. Witness took the child back to a pew, and noticing her moving her hands he asked one of his colleagues to see if anything had dropped upon the floor. They found a crimson plush purse containing a florin and a penny, at her feet, and she said this belonged to her and contained a penny. Witness subsequently asked her when she began to do this, and she said that a servant that she had met on the beach at Herne Bay had taught her how to do it. Cross-examined: He would most certainly have charged the child from what he saw, even if he had not found the purse. He had never seen the child do anything of the kind before. He did not give the child into custody on suspicion, because he knew that she did it. Mr. George Collier, commercial traveller, also a deacon at Rectory-road, said: When the child was taken into the vestry I took hold of the dear little thing by the hand and asked her to sit down on the sofa. She said she lived at home with her father and step- mother. She could not remember her mother. I said, ""Now, my dear little child, tell me why you have done this."" She replied, ""I have not done it.” I said, ""Now, tell me, and we will befriend you.” Mr. Bros: I am not sure I can take any more of your evidence. There is an inducement for her to make a confession, which is not evidence. Mr. Henry Fitzhenry, another commercial traveller, and deacon of the church in question, said that he recognised the child as one of whom the pastor spoke on the previous Sunday with regard to lost purses. He followed Mr. Branch, and saw the child moving her hands in a very suspicious manner amongst ladies' dresses. He generally corroborated the other witnesses. By Mr. Romain: Unless I had been set to watch possibly I might not have been suspicious of her. Mr. Henry Perkins deposed that the child, when charged, gave a correct address, and from inquiries he made he was of opinion that the child's parents were respectable. Mr. Bros: On this evidence I shall remand the girl in custody for a week. Mr. Romain asked permission to call the child's father, with a view of giving bail for the accused. Mr. Bros: If you can prove to me that the purse belongs to the child I might entertain your application. Mr. Romain: I can prove she is a quiet, well-behaved child, who has a money-box and saves most that she gets.

His lordship, in addressing the grand jury, referred to the charge against George Rice, signalman, of causing the death of ten persons at Norton Fitzwarren, and said that it was undoubted that the defendant had a duty to perform and did not do it, and that in consequence of his not doing so the lives of ten persons at least were sacrificed. The law on the point was that everyone who contracted to perform certain duties upon which the preservation of life depended, and who neglected to perform those duties, and thereby caused the death of any person, committed the same offence as if he had caused the same effect by an act done. It would be for the jury to consider what was the state of the man's mind when he was guilty of the offence—in other words, whether the neglect was culpable. He considered that they should find a true bill. —The grand jury retired, and returned into court with a true bill against the prisoner. They made a presentment to the effect that the attention of the Government should be called to the great danger involved in allowing trains to be shunted upon the main lines. —George Rice, sixty-three, signalman, was then indicted for the manslaughter of Robert Walker and nine other persons at Norton Fitzwarren on November 11th. —Mr. Douglas Metcalfe and Mr. Warry prosecuted; and Mr. Charles Mathews defended, whilst a number of counsel watched the proceedings on behalf of the Great Western Company. —The prisoner pleaded not guilty. —Noble, the driver of the goods train, was examined, and said he was on the up line nine or ten minutes before the special came up. The red light on his engine had just been removed as the special came in sight. He did not think the driver of the special could have seen witness's light at a greater distance than one hundred and fifty yards, and if the red light had been showing the speed of the special could not have been materially reduced, as it is a light train, and the rails were greasy. —Evidence was given that the prisoner a few months ago sustained a fracture of the ribs and slight lacerations about the head. His hours were from a quarter-past nine a.m. to a quarter past seven p.m. in alternate weeks. —Tovey, the telegraph clerk at Exeter, proved apprising Rice of the dispatch of the special train. —Albert Allen, signalman at the Victor crossing, next to Norton, on the Exeter side, proved receiving the same notification, and receiving at eighteen minutes past one, ""Line clear."" —Mr. Kemp, the Norton station-master, gave particulars as to when Rice went on duty. Mr. Wallington, a survivor of the first carriage, also gave evidence. —Dr. Willcocks stated that three weeks before the collision Rice was at his surgery, and he prescribed for pains in his head. —Mr. Campfield, district superintendent, said it was optional with the signalman to shunt the goods train on one of the branch lines. This concluded the case for the prosecution. —Mr. Charles Mathews called no evidence on behalf of the prisoner, but asked the jury to acquit him. He said they could not convict him for an error of judgment or exercise of faulty discretion. They must have it proved that he had been guilty of an act of gross culpability and criminal negligence. He also argued that the removal of the red light from the tail of the goods train was wrong. —The judge, in his summing-up, said he failed to see that the prisoner was not guilty of gross negligence, but it seemed to him that two other persons had also omitted to do their duty. He also complained of the goods traffic being shunted on the main line, and was glad the grand jury had called attention to the matter.

WILLIAM FAY, a smartly-dressed young man of nineteen, was charged, at the Bow-street Police-court, with stealing from the person, and on his case being put back till late in the afternoon found a companion in misfortune somewhat younger, named Francis Gray. The evidence of Mrs. Charlotte Kent, which was first taken, was to the effect that she was in Buckingham-street at about half-past six on the 24th inst., when a man snatched her bag, containing amongst other articles, some certificates of the most value to her, and ran off. Another at the same time said, ""All right, lady, I'll run and catch him,"" and both disappeared. On Monday last the prisoner Fay called at her residence and told her that he was aware of her loss and of the identity of those who had occasioned it, and that he was in a position to get her back at any rate a part of it. He produced a pocket-book that had been in the bag in evidence of this, and it was arranged that he should bring the other articles the next evening. But meanwhile Mrs. Kent communicated with the police, and when he arrived Detectives Hailstone and Temblett were already hidden behind the tapestry curtains, from which they emerged at an opportune moment, and arrested Fay. In consequence of a statement made by him at the station, Inspector George Payne, of the L Division, went to a house in Blackfriars road at half past four on Wednesday morning, and there found Gray in bed. He told him he should arrest him, and he replied that he knew all about it. In the course of the afternoon both men made statements in one another's presence. Fay's was to the effect that he was in the kitchen of the house in Blackfriars-road, when Gray came in with three men, named Irwin, Cook, and Simpson, who were in possession of the stolen property. They spoke of putting the things on the fire, when Fay said that the papers might be of value. He looked at them, and finding the address of Mrs. Kent, suggested that the bag and its contents should not be burnt, but that he should take it back to the owner. This was agreed to, and he took it and locked it up. Gray's statement confirmed this, with the exception that he said he was already in the kitchen when Irwin, Cook, and Simpson came in. Inspector Payne added that two of the men named were then in custody, and had been charged at the Southwark Police-court on information already given to him by Fay as to the suspected theft of two ulsters’, a coat, and a rug.

The wound was so serious that her removal from the house would be dangerous. She was in a critical condition. Remanded.",0.052113,0.176349,0.024296,0.051867
3200810322,"CHARGES AT MARLBOROUGH STREET. LOUISA GILLESPIE, an actress, was charged with being drunk and riotous in Bear-street, on Thursday evening. She promenaded, shouting and making some unearthly noises as she went along. Then she tripped and fell, and her nose coming in contact with the pavement, blood flowed freely. When at the station a surgeon was sent for to attend to the injuries; and in the morning, saying that ""such a thing had never happened to her before,"" she was leniently dealt with with, and let off with the payment of 5s., including the doctor's fee. Annie Price, shortly before twelve on Thursday night, showed signs of combativeness, and when a woman whom she regarded as a rival confronted her, a set-two followed, and they scratched each other furiously until a constable appeared and separated them. The rival retired, but the prisoner, not having had satisfaction, made for her again, and another combat ensued, and again they were pulled apart. The other woman then took to her heels, but as the prisoner remained and challenged the authority of the constable to remove her, she was very soon ushered within the walls of the police station. She was fined 10s. or seven days in default. ""Something flew into my head all at once, and then I went gidddy,"" was the defence offered by Robert Knight, an old cabman, who was charged with being drunk whilst in charge of his horse and hansom in the Haymarket on Thursday night. He was so far gone as to drive on the wrong side of the road, and for that and his insobriety he was fined 20s. William Padgham, another hansom driver, who was also charged with being drunk at midnight on Thursday, pleaded the awkwardness of his horse and his surprise that a constable should have been so uncharitable as to take him to the station, although he assured the magistrate that he had only a drop or two and went away as quietly as a lamb. The same fine was imposed. Thomas Braid was also fined 5s. for being unsteady in his gait when off the box of his hansom in Piccadilly at half-past twelve on Friday morning. As an excuse he said that he had not had anything to drink for a long time, when, unfortunately for him, a fare gave him a couple of glasses of whisky, and then his legs seemed to overlap each other. ""I was drunk, I know, but it was the first time during twenty years,"" said William Winhurst, who was inebriated when with his cab in Piccadilly-circus at twenty minutes to eleven the other night, and a 5s, fine had to be paid. James Wight pleaded guilty to being drunk while in charge of a hansom in Piccadilly at eleven o'clock at night, and in this case Mr. Newton said that if he was brought before him again under similar circumstances his licence would very likely be cancelled. He was ordered to pay 20s. or go to prison for fourteen days. Thomas Jacques, a labourer, was charged with being disorderly in Whitfield-street the other night, with refusing to quit the Lamb Tavern when ordered to do go, and with assaulting Mr. Max Meyers, the landlord, Ann Alfred Foakes, his potman, by biting their hands. Prisoner was very noisy and quarrelsome, and on the landlord telling him that he was like an old woman he became exceedingly abusive, and was ordered to leave the bar. He refused, and when physical force had to be used he threw himself down and fixed his teeth into the hands of the complainants.

3200810451,"EXTRAORDINARY DEATH OF A POLICE CONSTABLE. MR. JOHN TROUTBECK, the coroner for Westminster, held an inquiry into the circumstances attending the death of Police-constable Joseph Daniels, 259 E, aged twenty-seven years, who was killed early on Sunday morning while taking a prisoner to Bow-street Police-station. Superintendent Steggles, of the E division, was present. Joseph Daniels, a registration agent, of 9, Meeting-House-lane, Peckham, identified the deceased as his son, lately residing at Jubilee-buildings, Waterloo-road. Sometime ago he had erysipelas and the divisional surgeon ordered him to have some of his teeth extracted and replaced by false ones. These he was wearing at the time of his death. Police-constable Alfred Smith, 379 E, said that on Sunday morning at about 12.20 he was in Kemble-street, Clare-market, taking a prisoner to Bow-street Police-station. A crowd of several hundred persons had assembled, and an attempt to rescue the man was made. Witness blew his whistle, and in response the deceased came running up. He took hold of the prisoner’s other arm, and they had only proceeded a few yards, when witnessed missed the deceased, and on looking round saw him lying on the pavement. Another constable came up, and witness went on his way. Police-constable William Stewart, 350 E, said that he was on duty in New-castle-street, when he heard the whistle blow, and ongoing to Kemble street, saw the two constables with a man in custody. Witness broke through the crowd, and then saw the deceased lying on the ground. He immediately undid his collar and sent for an ambulance, on which he conveyed the unfortunate man to the hospital. By the Coroner: The deceased was not knocked down, kicked, or otherwise assaulted. Dr. Eric Law Pritchard house physician at King’s College Hospital, said that deceased was dead when admitted. He had made a post-mortem examination, which revealed that he deceased was an exceedingly healthy man. Just about the larynx witness found a set of false teeth impacted, which had produced suffocation, the cause of death. The teeth were of very inferior make; no doubt they became loosened through the deceased running, and an inspiration drew them down his throat. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and added that they thought deceased was over anxious to do his duty.","rXTInAO~DlINiARY DEATH OF A POLICE I CONSTABLE. _ Mat.

3200810452,"ATTEMPTED DOUBLE MURDER AND SUICIDE INTENSE excitement was caused in Stood, a town adjoining the city of Rochester, early Friday morning by the report that a shoemaker named Frederick Marrs had nearly succeeded in murdering his wife and son, aged fifteen. It seems that Marrs attacked his wife with a hammer at three a.m. After receiving nine terrible wounds on her head she managed to escape into a neighbour's house. The infuriated shoemaker then turned upon his son, who, by leaping from the top of the stairs to the bottom, managed to escape into the street and inform the police of what had occurred. A constable soon arrived on the scene, and conveyed Marrs to the cells of the Rochester Police-station, where he attempted suicide by tying a scarf tightly round his neck. Blood was issuing from his ears and he was nearly dead when the constable in charge happened to look into his cell, saw the man's condition, rushed in, and took the scarf off. The woman is in a dying condition, and her depositions were taken in the course of the day. Frederick Marrs, was brought before the magistrates at Strood, on Saturday, charged with feloniously wounding his wife at Strood with intent to murder her. The woman, who is lying in a very critical condition, was visited on Friday night by the magistrates, who took her depositions in the presence of the prisoner. The room in which the assault was committed was in a terrible condition. The furniture was smashed to pieces and the floor was saturated with blood. Mrs. Marrs stated that she was aroused from her sleep at three o'clock on Friday morning by her husband striking her on the head with a shoemaker's hammer. She jumped out of bed and struggled to take the hammer away from him, but he seized her by the throat, and in his frenzy tore the flesh away, laying bare the wind-pipe. She could not get away from Marrs, who struck blow after blow with the hammer, hitting her on the head and face. Finally, he dragged her to the staircase, and attempted to throw her down; but she managed to tear herself away, and escaped into a neighbouring house. It was then found that her features were battered out of recognition. Her nose was laid open from the forehead to the tip, the right cheek-bone was broken, the right ear was torn apparently with the hook of the hammer, both eyes were blackened and closed, and one rib was fractured. The prisoner appeared to be in a dazed condition, and seemed to have little recollection of the terrible occurrence; and the magistrates, without going into the case, remanded him.

3200810563,"THE DOMESTIC SERVANT AND HER BABY. MR. G. P. WYATT, coroner for East Surrey, held an inquest at the Railway Tavern, New-cross, on the body of Arthur William Lapworth, aged eighteen days, the child of Mary Ann Lapworth, a domestic servant. The mother said the child was born at 59, Hatcham Park-road. The witness went there in consequence of an advertisement she saw in the Sunday papers. She agreed to pay Mrs. Church, the landlady, who was to attend her, 15s. per week previous to her confinement, and a guinea a week afterwards. Nothing was said to her about the doctor’s fee. The medical man attended her when the child was born, but she did not see him afterwards. By the Coroner: She did not understand that it was necessary for a doctor to call a second time. Mrs. Church did not suggest that the doctor should not see her again, but she once said to her, “The doctor has come to see the child. I suppose you do not want to see him?” to which the witness replied, “No, I don’t think so.” There were three other young children in the house when the witness first went, but two of them were taken away last week. Eleanor Church, of the above address, stated that the deceased was fed on milk and water. She did not think it necessary for the doctor to attend again after the confinement as the patient got on very well. The Coroner: I should have thought you would have wished him to call, as you paid him out of your own pocket. Witness: Oh, no. the mothers have to pay that, and I told the last witness so. In fact, after she got convalescent we went together and pawned her watch and chain with which to pay him. The witness, continuing, said that she was not a registered midwife, or she would not have called in medical aid; she was only a nurse. By the Coroner: How many children have you in the house in the course of a year—a hundred? The Witness: Oh, no, certainly not. By a Juryman: The mother registered the birth. The witness had not insured its life. Dr. C. Wallace, of 211, New-cross road, stated that he was called in on June 8th; the child was born when he arrived; he did not see it again until Saturday; it was then in a dying state. He attended it until its death, which took place the following day. By the Coroner: Is it not usual for a medical man to attend a woman in her confinement until the ninth or tenth day? The Witness: Yes; I called the next morning, and Mrs. Church said that the mother of the child did not desire to see me. I attended two other cases in the same house recently and was treated in the same way. The deceased was healthy when born. I made a post-mortem examination of the body, which was much emaciated, and weighed only 41b. 5oz., the average weight being between 61/2lb. and 7lb. There was scarcely any fat about the body, and the stomach contained a little partly-digested food. The immediate cause of death was exhaustion, resulting from a convulsive fit. The jury eventually returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.","r M.E DOMESTIC MEwlVAIT AND Ey, BABY. . .1 I MiR. G. P.

Wyatt, coroner for East Surrey, held an inquest at the Railway Tavern, New-cross, on the body of Arthur William Lapworth, aged eighteen days, the child of Mary Ann Lapworth, a domestic servant. The mother said the child was born at 50, Hatcham Parkroad. The witness went there in consequence of an advertisement she saw in the Sunday papers. She agreed to pay Mrs Church, the landlady, who was to attend her, 15s. per week previous to her confluence, and a guinea a week afterwards. Nothing was said to her about the doctor's fee. The medical man attended her when the child was born, but she did not see him afterwards. By the Coroner: She did not understand that it was necessary for a doctor to call a second time. Mrs Church did not suggest that the doctor should not see her again, but she once said to her, ""The doctor has come to see the child. I suppose you do not want to see him?"" to which the witness replied, ""No, I don't think so."" There were three other young children in the house when the witness first went, but two of them were taken away last week. Eleanor Church, of the above address, stated that the deceased was fed on milk and water. She did not think it necessary for the doctor to attend again after the confinement, as the patient got on very well. The Coroner: I should have thought you would have wished him to call, as you paid him out of your own pocket. Witness: Oh, no. The mothers have to pay that, and I told the last witness so. In fact, after she got convalescent we went together and pawned her watch and chain with which to pay him. The witness, continuing, said that she was not a registered midwife, or she would not have called in medical aid; she was only a nurse. By the Coroner: How many children have you in the house in the course of a year—a hundred? The Witness: Oh, no, certainly not. By a Juryman: The mother registered the birth. The witness had not insured its life. Dr. C. Wallace, of 241, New-cross-road, stated that he was called in on June 8th; the child was born when he arrived; he did not see it again until Saturday; it was then in a dying state. He attended it until its death, which took place the following day. By the Coroner: Is it not usual for a medical man to attend a woman in her confinement until the ninth or tenth day? The Witness: Yes; I called the next morning, and Mrs Church said that the mother of the child did not desire to see me. I attended two other cases in the same house recently, and was treated in the same way. The deceased was healthy when born. I made a post-mortem examination of the body, which was much emaciated, and weighed only 4lb. 5oz., the average weight being between 6lb. and 7lb. There was scarcely any fat about the body, and the stomach contained a little partly-digested food. The immediate cause of death was exhaustion, resulting from a convulsive fit. The jury eventually returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.",0.131016,0.376130,0.011698,0.045208
3200810564,"A CONSTABLE COMMITTED FOR TRIAL. THE hearing of the case against Police-constable Pearce, 490 M, who is charged upon a summons with assaulting a young fellow named Briggs, and which has occupied the attention of Mr. Fenwick during a considerable portion of the week, was resumed, at the Southwark Police-court, Mr. Sydney again appearing for the defendant. Police-constable Mittens, 233 M, who, it will be remembered, corroborated the man Briggs as to the alleged assault, was recalled, and in answer to Mr. Sydney admitted that he, while stationed at Greenwich, was fined two or three days' pay, and, when further pressed, that the fine was inflicted for telling deliberate falsehoods in connection with a report which he made to his superior officers. At this stage Mr. Fenwick expressed a wish to bear the evidence of a young man named Devine, who followed the parties to the station. When in the box Devine said he walked behind the defendant and saw no assault committed. He did hear 233 M say that the accused had struck Briggs, but as he (witness) was ordered to attend the court next morning he did not think it worthwhile contradicting him at the time. Police-constable Greenwood, 272 M, the officer whom Briggs alleges gave him 10s. ""to square the ease,"" was next called, and denied the statement in toto. He further deposed that, as Briggs left the court on the day he was charged with assaulting the defendant, he said to witness, ""What that old copper (233) says is lies, but I'll say it's true unless he in brasses up. I mean to get a bit of my own back, and it is worth three quid to put me out of the way for a time."" John Briggs, the brother of the complainant, then gave evidence as to being ""treated ""by Police-constable 272, whom he heard make overtures to his brother to “square it."" Mr. Sydney, addressing his worship, observed that during the course of the inquiry a very serious allegation against Mr. Stevens, the inspector who is took the charge against Briggs, was made, which was that when he (the complainant) was put forward that the defendant committed an assault, and directly his worship had ordered a summons to be issued had actually in the court told the defendant to square them matter. He desired to say on the inspector's behalf that he had two officers of the court—one the usher—who would tell his worship that Inspector Stevens did not leave the witness-box until close upon half an hour after the case had been disposed of and all the parties had gone. Mr. Fenwick said he was sorry he could not allow the statement to go upon the depositions, as it was not germane to the inquiry, but he would certainly direct that the officers mentioned should attend the sessions for the purpose of giving evidence if the Court desired it. Police constable 233 here stepped forward, and said he wished to add to his evidence the fact that Inspector Stevens had on more than one occasion reported him, and given him a “jacketing."" Mr. Fenwick said that, having regard to the serious issues involved, and to the fact that other proceedings must inevitably arise out of these, he was of opinion that the case was eminently one which should go before a jury, and accordingly committed the defendant for trial on his own recognisances.","A COSTAtBL1) COMAITTFiO 70Z 'TRIAL.

LANGHAM, coroner, held an inquiry at St. Bartholomew's Hospital with respect to the death of John Reed, twenty-one, a meat-market porter, of Stamford-street, Blackfriars, who is alleged to have been stabbed by a boot and shoe maker named Robert Rosenkranz, in a shop in St. John-street, Clerkenwell. Robert Somerville, a little boy, deposed that he lived at 5, Rahere-street, Clerkenwell, and was employed at Rosenkranz's shop. On Saturday morning three men entered the shop.

Percy Waghorn, whose head was swathed in surgical bandages, said that the deceased was his brother. They were both employed at the same stable. On Monday afternoon they were exercising two of his master's horses, and had proceeded as far as the Surrey side of Chelsea-bridge when both the animals became frightened at the shrieks of the whistles on the river and the shouts of the people attending the race for the “Doggett's Coat and Badge,” which was being rowed at the time. The horses dashed through Battersea Park into the square, where they both collided with a miller's van which happened to be passing at the time. Deceased, whose horse was killed on the spot, was thrown underneath the vane one of the hind wheels of which passed over his chest. Witness's horse mounted the back of the van, and threw him into the road on his head; he remembered no more as he was rendered unconscious. By a Juryman: Deceased was a good horseman and was used to animals. Witness had hold of the head of the horse ridden by deceased at the time they bolted, but was compelled to let go, or he would have been pulled out of his saddle. He could have steadied his own horse, but instead of so doing went in pursuit of his brother, who had evidently lost all control over his animal. Police-constable Thomas Edwards, 517 V Division, who was on duty near the spot, after attempting to arrest the progress of last witness's horse, which was ultimately captured uninjured, went to the assistance of deceased, and subsequently conveyed him to St. Thomas's Hospital in a cab, where he was seen by the house surgeon and at once admitted. Dr. J. R. Box stated that when he saw deceased he was suffering from shock to the system and internal hemorrhage. He also had a large scalp wound and fractured skull; He died about an hour after his admission. A post-mortem examination had been made on the body, which showed that deceased had five ribs fractured, as well as a lacerated lung.

Mr. Wishart, of Jewin-street, City, deposed that the father of the deceased was an eminent clock manufacturer in Lenz Kirst, Black Forest, Germany.

Mr. Gill, on behalf of the prisoner, pointed out that she belonged to a most respectable family, and up to the present charges she had borne an excellent character. At the time that she committed the offences, and for some time previously, she had been suffering from a very severe attack of hysteria, and had had to be attended by two medical men, and this appeared to have been the cause of her conduct. Of course the Post Office authorities had been put to very great annoyance and inconvenience, but as regarded the forgery no actual pecuniary loss had been sustained. As to the charges and imputations made by the prisoner in the letters and postcards, which formed the subject of one of the indictments, there was not the slightest grounds for them. The father of the prisoner, her nurse, medical adviser, and the vicar of Upper Tooting, the locality in which she resided, were called to speak as to the state of the health of Miss Illingworth during the period over which the offences of extended. The Recorder, in passing sentence, told the prisoner that he respited sentence in order that the fullest inquiry might be made into her state of health. He had heard the evidence adduced as to her health, but at the same time it was impossible to deal with cases of this kind unless he treated them as most serious. By a remarkable facility, which she undoubtedly possessed, of imitating handwriting, she had jeopardised the liberty and character of a young lady, the complainant, against whom no charge could have been made; and so successfully had she imitated handwriting that she had deceived a most experienced expert in handwriting, and the young lady was in an ace of being convicted on a groundless charge. She (the prisoner) had been convicted on two charges-although there were many other charges which he did not think it necessary should be proceeded with. She had been convicted of forging an order for the payment of money, the forgery being due to her skill in imitating handwriting, which she no doubt believed would avoid detection. In addition, the jury had found her guilty of sending libelous postcards and letters through the post; and, notwithstanding the kindness of the late Mr. Raikes, when Postmaster-General—who, having had the matter drawn to his attention, promised not to take steps against her if she would desist in her conduct—she still persisted in sending the objection-able missives, having given her assurance not to do so.

Mr. E. Godden, assistant master, appeared to watch the case on behalf of the Orphan Working School, Haverstock-hill, N.W.

On the 31st of August an excision of the head of the left arm was made. He gradually grew worse, and died. John Herbert Fisher said he was one of the house-surgeons at St. Thomas's Hospital. The deceased was a delicate boy, and lost a great quantity of blood. Death took place on the 13th inst. from exhaustion, following the fracture of the head of the left arm caused by striking himself with a bat while playing at cricket. Mr. Algernon Coote, secretary to the Orphan School, proved that he visited the deceased, and the latter told him that his injuries were the result of an accident.

On the 2nd of August the deceased received a parcel, when several of his school mates gathered around him to ascertain its contents. In their eagerness the deceased was pushed down, and his left arm was bent beneath, and broken. He was again admitted to the school infirmary, where he remained until the 15th of the same month, when it was deemed expedient to remove him to St. Thomas's Hospital, under the care of Mr. Clutton, who discovered that Carrington was suffering from fracture of surgical neck of humerus (left). On the 31st of August an excision of the head of the left arm was made. He gradually grew worse, and died. John Herbert Fisher said he was one of the house-surgeons at St. Thomas's Hospital. The deceased was a delicate boy, and lost a great quantity of blood. Death took place on the 13th inst. from exhaustion, following the fracture of the head of the left arm caused by striking himself with a bat while playing at cricket. Mr. Algernon Coote, secretary to the Orphan School, proved that he visited the deceased, and the latter told him that his injuries were the result of an accident. The jury returned a verdict of accidental death.",0.035888,0.120198,0.009922,0.012392

3200811325,"ARREST OF DE COBAIN. MR. E. S. W. DE COBAIN, ex-member of Parliament for East Belfast, was arrested on Friday night at his residence, Hampton House, Ormean-road, Belfast. About two years have elapsed since Mr. De Cobain left this country. The police for a long time made every effort to arrest him, but without success until Friday night, when two detectives succeeded in doing so. It is rumoured that he has been in Belfast for close upon a fortnight. Mr. De Cobain was originally a clerk to the Belfast Harbour Board, and afterwards was appointed cashier to the corporation. While there he became grand master of the Belfast Orangemen and wielded for a time a good deal of influence in political circles. At length he succeeded in getting returned for the East Division, for which he sat for several years. Serious immoral charges were made against him and he left for the continent. After a long absence he was expelled from the House of Commons. The prisoner was brought up on Saturday at the Belfast Police-court. He entered from the Summons, Court, and seated himself on one of the benches reserved for witnesses, but on his name being called took up his position in the dock, where he was accommodated with a seat. He looked pale but somewhat stouter than when last seen in Belfast. When the case was called the court, which was crowded with professional gentlemen, police officers, and the general public, was ordered to be cleared. Head Constable Hussey, of the Belfast detective force, deposed to arresting, the prisoner on charges contained in the warrant produced. When arrested the accused said, I have been out of jurisdiction. I have been in New York. I have been here some time. Were you aware of that in consequence of the shortness of the time witness had not been able to produce witnesses, but if a remand was granted he believed he would be able to connect the accused with the crime mentioned in the warrant. The date of the warrant was April 2nd, 1891 Mr. Harper, solicitor for Mr. De Cobain (to witness): The place where you arrested the accused was well known as his residence when he was living in Belfast? Yes; when he was living in Belfast. Mr. Harper: You know that at the time you received this warrant he was residing out of Ireland? I am not personally aware that he was. I did not see him. But you had not seen him in Ireland at that time, nor since? No. When you arrested him did he suggest that he should be brought before one of the resident magistrates? No; he suggested that I should bring him before another gentleman. Mr. Carr: Did you hear the prisoner state that he had been five weeks in Belfast? No. The accused was then remanded on bail, but as no satisfactory sureties were forthcoming he was removed to prison four hours later.","ARR'ESr OF DE COBAIN. . - X- IT- rs- _- - A I _ _ c- 1 a&ras US U LF %UDJ41214.

De Cobain, ex-member of Parliament for East Belfast, was arrested on Friday night at his residence, Hampton House, Ormean-road, Belfast. About two years have elapsed since Mr. De Cobain left this country. The police for a long time made every effort to arrest him, but without success until Friday night, when two detectives succeeded in doing so. It is rumoured that he has been in Belfast for close upon a fortnight. Mr. De Cobain was originally a clerk to the Belfast Harbour Board, and afterwards was appointed cashier to the corporation. While there he became grand master of the Belfast Orangemen and wielded for a time a good deal of influence in political circles. At length he succeeded in getting returned for the East Division, for which he sat for several years. Serious immoral charges were made against him and he left for the continent. After a long absence he was expelled from the House of Commons. The prisoner was brought up on Saturday at the Belfast Police court. He entered from the Summons Court, and seated himself on one of the benches reserved for witnesses, but on his name being called took up his position in the dock, where he was accommodated with a seat. He looked pale but somewhat stouter than when last seen in Belfast. When the case was called the court, which was crowded with professional gentlemen, police officers, and the general public, was ordered to be cleared. Head Constable Ensey, of the Belfast Detective force, deposed to arresting, the prisoner on charges contained in the warrant produced. When arrested the accused said, ""I have been out of jurisdiction. I have been in New York. I have been here some time. Were you aware of that?"" In consequence of the shortness of the time witness had not been able to produce witnesses, but if a remand was granted he believed he would be able to connect the accused with the crime mentioned in the warrant. The date of the warrant was April 2nd, 1891. Mr. Harper, solicitor for Mr. De Cobain (to witness): The place where you arrested the accused was well known as his residence when he was living in Belfast? Yes; when he was living in Belfast, Mr. Harper: You know that at the time you received this warrant he was residing out of Ireland? I am not personally aware that he was. I did not see him. But you had not seen him in Ireland at that time, nor since? No. When you arrested him did he suggest that he should be brought before one of the resident magis. irates? No; he suggested that I should bring him before another gentleman. Mr. Carr: Did you hear the prisoner state that he had been five weeks in Belfast? No. The accused was then remanded on bail; but as no satisfactory sureties were forthcoming he was removed to prison four hours later.",0.154290,0.440162,0.008291,0.032454
3200811330,"THE BUTCHER AND HIS SISTER-IN-LAW. AT the West London Police-court, on Saturday, William Payne, a master butcher, carrying on business in King's Langley, Watford, appeared to answer a summons at the instance of his sister-in-law, Sarah Ann Payne, who alleged that he was the father of her child. Mr. C. Robinson appeared for the defendant, who disputed the paternity. It appeared from the evidence that the complainant kept a pork butcher's shop in High street, Watford, and on the death of her husband the defendant managed her affairs. She was now living in Portobello-road, Notting Hill, having left Watford in consequence of her condition. In answer to questions the complainant said a man came to the shop to do the chopping. Several men called on business matters, but she had heard no complaint about the house. The defendant paid the doctor's expenses. Mr. Robinson said the intimacy was admitted, but not at the time stated by the complainant. The defendant was sworn and said he did not pay the doctor. He gave complainant money, but only in the way of business. He was a married man. Several letters were handed in by the complainant, and the defendant was questioned about three which he admitted were in his handwriting. One was dated December 1st, 1892, commencing ""Dear Sis,"" and ended ""with love from H. H. Market."" The defendant said the signature meant Hemel Hempstead Market. The letter contained the words ""Cheer up, old girl. Good-bye. It will soon be Christmas."" The second letter was signed ""W. B.,"" the defendant stating that the letters meant ""West Brighton."" The third had ""W."" attached to it. Mr. Curtis Bennett: I suppose that means William. (Laughter.) George Taylor said he lived in High-street, Watford, opposite the shop. He had seen men come out of the shop late at night. Joseph Bunce, who worked for the complainant, was also called and said he had left a man in the house late at night. Mr. Curtis Bennett, at the conclusion of the case, described the defendant's conduct as mean—turning his back upon the complainant. He made an order for 5s. a week, with 10 gs. costs. Mr. Robinson submitted that the magistrate could not give more costs than those actually incurred. Mr. Curtis Bennett: Look at the statute. We have power to grant what costs we like. ___________________________________ DUEL TO THE DEATH.

The boy was a dark-eyed little fellow, with black curly hair, and being a bright child, was noticed and petted by the neighbours and children around. There are two other children—a boy Wilfred, aged eight, and a girl Grace, aged six—and all that can be said about them at present is that they are supposed to be the children of Mary Green, the prisoner in custody.

A little more than two years ago she resided in Newton-street and subsequently lodged with a midwife. The neighbours considered she had one great fault, and that was a habit of sitting with her head out of the window, or being out in the front nearly all day, reading novels, till at last she fell into lazy habits, and neglected both herself and her children. She was in receipt of about £2 10s. per month, which used to come regularly by post. Towards the end of each month she would run into debt, but paid up when her money arrived. She used to be visited by a gentleman somewhat older than herself, who she used to say was her father, but beyond that she was very reticent as to her affairs.

She would reply, ""My appearance is good enough for me and the position I am in now, and I have no heart for anything."" About April last the calls of the visitor ceased, and the woman then seemed to become depressed. The children were shockingly neglected and dirty, and the little girl was both weakly and diseased.

She gradually sold her furniture, and getting eight weeks in arrears for rent, received notice to leave. As she clung to her rooms the landlady removed into Barnard-road, nearby, and Mrs. James was left in the house by herself. Several days before the murder, the eldest little boy told a neighbour that they were all going to leave, for ""they were going to live in Clapton-pond."" The next day the children were startled by the mother seizing the elder boy, as though about to strangle him, but the door in some mysterious way flew open, and she desisted. On Saturday, the 11th, the children had no food till the mother sold the last things she had—some saucepans and other household utensils, for which she got 3s. When Sunday came, with no dinner, no fire, no food, no hope, the tragedy began with the strangling of the youngest child. His terrible death struggles awakened the mother to a sense of pity for the elder boy and girl; and taking them to the police-station she asked what she was to do with them. She then gave herself up for the terrible crime he had committed.

He was ordered out in of the house and went to Pimlico, where the girl joined him in a day or two, giving cut, when she left home, that she was going to visit her sister. Letters from her found on the prisoner showed that she addressed him in the most endearing terms. On the prisoner being placed in the dock, the girl Florence fainted. She was led out of the court soon afterwards in a violently hysterical condition.

He took her to a place—some chambers she did not know. A man in the doorway remarked, ""You have soon come back."" Prisoner answered, ""Yes, and I have brought my wife with me."" He did not leave the room she had to occupy during the night. The witness, much agitated, gave some further evidence in support of, the more serious aspect of the charge, and, in answer to the magistrate, she said that on the following morning prisoner walked back with her to Commercial-road. They had breakfast together there. She never saw him afterwards till he was in custody. Inspector Campion suggested that the girl should be asked about a statement which the prisoner made to her. Witness said that on the Friday night she met the prisoner. He told her to tell people that she was his wife and first cousin—an orphan. After some hesitation the prisoner decided to give evidence, which he is entitled to do under the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The result was a material corroboration of the girl's testimony. He said that, as arranged on Good Friday, he sent her his address, but he could not see that this enticed her from Sutton. He asked her to return there, and she refused.

She was led out of the court soon afterwards in a violently hysterical condition. After a considerable interval, although weak and ill, she was enabled, with her face averted from the dock, to give some evidence. She said that the prisoner wrote her a number of letters. He left Sutton in March. On Friday, the 7th inst., in consequence of a letter from the prisoner, she left her home at Sutton unknown to her parents, and came to Victoria Station. She proceeded to the prisoner's lodgings at Commercial-road, Pimlico, as she had been directed. Prisoner met her, and said that he had found a room for her at a sort of mission-house. He took her to a place—some chambers she did not know. A man in the doorway remarked, ""You have soon come back."" Prisoner answered, ""Yes, and I have brought my wife with me."" He did not leave the room she had to occupy during the night. The witness, much agitated, gave some further evidence in support of the more serious aspect of the charge, and, in answer to the magistrate, she said that on the following morning prisoner walked back with her to Commercial-road. They had breakfast together there. She never saw him afterwards till he was in custody. Inspector Campion suggested that the girl should be asked about a statement which the prisoner made to her. Witness said that on the Friday night she met the prisoner. He told her to tell people that she was his wife and first cousin—an orphan. After some hesitation the prisoner decided to give evidence, which he is entitled to do under the Criminal Law Amendment Act. The result was a material corroboration of the girl's testimony. He said that, as arranged on Good Friday, he sent her his address, but he could not see that this enticed her from Sutton. He asked her to return there, and she refused. In answer to Mr. De Rutzen, he said he took a room as she had stated. The Magistrate: You don't wish to say any more? No, sir. Or in any way to deny the statements made by your niece as to what took place? My niece told me to say that she was my wife. Mr. De Rutzen committed the prisoner for trial to the Central Criminal Court.",0.128719,0.254209,0.003947,0.011785

[SUBJECT OF ILLUSTRATION.] A WOMAN, named Emma Hill, aged thirty-two years, the wife of a Covent-garden porter, was stabbed with fatal effect during a quarrel, which occurred outside King College Hospital, Portugal-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, it appears that an altercation arose between the woman and a man, supposed to be her husband, in Portugal street. A struggle ensued, and several blows are stated to have been struck. The woman suddenly cried out that she was stabbed, and immediately fell to the ground. The hall porter at King's College Hospital, hearing the woman scream, rushed out, and was just in time to see her in the act of falling. At the same moment he saw a man running in the direction of Chancery-lane. He found the woman lying on the pavement in a pool of blood, and nearly unconscious. She was at once conveyed into the hospital, where she was found to be in a very critical condition, and suffering from a severe stab in the breast. The wound had evidently been inflicted with a large knife. She lingered, on until Sunday morning, when, as it was seen that she was, sinking her depositions were taken with the result that her husband was later in the afternoon arrested at Woolwich and conveyed to Bow-street Police station. The woman died at 10.45 a.m. She is stated to be the mother of three children. At Bow-street Police-court, Jacob Hill, thirty, described as a market porter, of Gilbert's passage, Clare-market, was charged before Mr. Lushington with the wilful murder of his wife, Emma Hill, by stabbing her in the left breast with a knife. Formal evidence only was given to justify a remand. The prisoner's statement when arrested was read in court. He said that he had been drinking with his wife in a public-house. She had two half-pints of beer while he had one. He saw the beer was taking effect on her, and told her she had better get something to eat. She then turned round and used an objectionable expression. ""I walked away from her,"" he continued, ""and she followed me. I had a knife in my hand trimming my nails. She struck me, and I put up my hands to ward off the blow. As she pulled my arms down the knife entered her breast. My life has been a misery since I married her twelve months ago.

3200811892,"DARING JEWEL ROBBERY. A ROBBERY of valuable jewellery, the property of the Countess Howe, was effected at Portsmouth Harbour Railway Station shortly after noon on Sunday. A special train, with the Prince and Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar, the Countess Howe, and other guests of the Duke of Richmond during the Goodwood week, reached the station just after a steam packet in which they intended to cross to Cowes had moved off from the station pier. It was decided to take passage in another boat, with the view of joining the Cowes steamer at Clarence Esplanade Pier, Southsea. At this time the traffic to and from the Isle of Wight is exceptionally heavy, and at noon on Sunday the railway staff were busily engaged in facilitating the transfer of luggage from train to steamer, and vice versa. A crane is employed to remove an iron “cage,” which will hold a large quantity of goods. This cage, which is in charge of the railway servants, was fully employed during the morning. The luggage of Prince and Princess Edward and the other passengers by the special was placed in the cage, which was about to be set in motion, when a lady’s maid in the employ of the Countess Howe, who had travelled from Chichester in charge of a dressing-case containing a quantity of her mistress’s jewellery, was proceeding to the steamer. On reaching the cage, and learning that it was to be swung from the station and on to the deck of the steamer, which was lying alongside the pier below, she, by direction, it is said, of Countess Howe, placed the case, which was somewhat heavy, in the cage. It is believed that some other article was placed on the top of it, and that immediately after the crane was in motion. The maid was under the impression that it would reach the steamer as soon as she did, and she at once went down two flights of steps on to the pier and passed over to the steamer. The cage was in course of transit, and on its reaching the deck the servant went to where it alighted to resume possession of the dressing-case, when, to her consternation, it was missing. An alarm was at once raised, but the thief or thieves had by this time got clear of the station. Within a brief period a detective officer was on the spot and a searching inquiry was instituted. No one was seen to touch the cage, but it is clear that someone managed to get possession of the case. Up to the present the police have not succeeded in making an arrest. The articles of jewellery were of the value of upwards of £1,000. The case contained also £90 in bank notes an gold.","DARING JEWEL ROBBEIRY.

3200812244,"EXTRAORDINARY BLACKMAILING CHARGE. AT Bow-street, a man whose name was given as Charles Howard, with several aliases, aged seventy, was charged, on remand, under the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, with being a suspected person, getting his living by dishonest means, and also with obtaining £22 from Col. Aldworth by false pretences, and fraudulently obtaining £21 from George Harvey, of Malin Hall, County Donegal. Mr. Sims, who prosecuted for the Treasury, said the charges of fraud against the prisoner were founded on a voluminous correspondence, which would have to be gone into. The accused went to Cowley House, Great College-street, Westminster, and traded as Williams, Murray, M'Donald and Co., Australian merchants. Mr. Sims read letters in which it was represented that the writer had received a colonial newspaper which advertised for a relative of the persons with whom he happened to be in communication. At prisoner's lodgings in Oakley crescent, Chelsea (continued Mr. Sime), Detective-inspector Baker found a complete chart for swindling members of the nobility on the plea of making inquiries on various delicate matters. Two sheets of paper contained drafts of letters, in the prisoner's handwriting, to noblemen and others, in which he offered for £50 to obtain certain incriminating letters, and to provide evidence against their wives. Other letters offered for £100 to secure the return of the person addressed to Parliament, and to bring about marriage with a young Australian lady possessing thousands a year. There were also eleven drafts of letters bearing the names of 157 peers and baronets. These were marked, ""Good for marriage"" —(Laughter) — and a large bundle of letters from peers and baronets, addressed, ""Colonel Barron, Oakley-crescent, Chelsea,"" upon the subject of the Australian heiress. The chart was marked ""Notes for Replies,"" and contained ninety-two numbered paragraphs in the handwriting of the prisoner, so that he could copy a reply suitable to the person addressed. He was thus in a position to work a combination matrimonial and detective agency by himself alone.

Edlin, Q.C., Henry Conway, nineteen, clerk, who last sessions pleaded guilty to having broken into the shop, of Edward Wallis Perry, a jeweller, of Oxford-street, and stealing therein twenty-six diamond rings, valued at £420, was brought up for sentence. The prisoner took up a stone of twelve pounds in weight, and threw it through the prosecutor's window, from which he took out three trays of rings. He was caught with them under his arm, and only three, valued at about £49, were missing. He said he was a member of the Commonweal Anarchists, and had done it for the common good. The prisoner was stated to have been a frequent speaker at the unemployed meetings at Tower-hill, and Anarchist meetings at Hyde Park and Regent's Park. Dr. Gilbert, from Holloway Prison said the prisoner was perfectly sane. In passing sentence Sir Peter Edlin said — ""Airs of bravado and callous indifference are as silly as they are unbecoming. Despising steady work, and not ashamed to steal, you talk of sympathy and concern for the unemployed. Demagogues who go about inciting to violence and robbery are the worst enemies of labour, and it is desirable that they should be exposed to the public gaze in their true colours. You must be stripped of the fine feathers in which you would deck yourself and plainly described as what you are—a dangerous thief. The sooner you rid your mind of the vicious doctrines you profess to have adopted the better for your peace. You will have time for reflection.

At Bow-street, a man whose name was given as Charles Howard, with several aliases, aged seventy, was charged, on remand, under the Prevention of Crimes Act, 1871, with being a suspected person, getting his living by dishonest means, and also with obtaining £22 from Col. Aldworth by false pretences, and fraudulently obtaining £21 from George Harvey, of Malin Hall, County Donegal. Mr. Sims, who prosecuted for the Treasury, said the charges of fraud against the prisoner were founded on a voluminous correspondence, which would have to be gone into. The accused went to Cowley House, Great College-street, Westminster, and traded as Williams, Murray. McDonald and Co., Australian merchants. Mr. Sims read letters in which it was represented that the writer had received a colonial newspaper which advertised for a relative of the perons with whom he happened to be in communication. At prisoner's lodgings in Oakley-crescent, Chelsea (continued Mr. Sims), Detective-inspector Baker found a complete chart for swindling members of the nobility on the plea of making inquiries on various delicate matters. Two sheets of paper contained drafts of letters, in the prisoner's handwriting, to noblemen and others, in which he offered for £50 to obtain certain incriminating letters, and to provide evidence against their wives. Other letters offered for £100 to secure the return of the person addressed to Parliament, and to bring about marriage with a young Australian lady possessing thousands a year. There were also eleven drafts of letters bearing the names of 157 peers and baronets. These were marked, ""Good for marriage""—(Laughter)—and a large bundle of letters from peers and baronets, addressed, ""Colonel Barron, Oakley-crescent, Chelsea,"" upon the subject of the Australian heiress. The chart was marked ""Notes for Replies,"" and contained ninety-two numbered paragraphs in the handwriting of the prisoner, so that he could copy a reply suitable to the person addressed. He was thus in a position to work a combination matrimonial and detective agency by himself alone. Colonel Richard Aldworth gave evidence in support of counsel's statement that he had paid Howard £2 as an inquiry fee. The prisoner's landlady said the prisoner used to have copying done by boys.

3200812246,"THE TRIAL OF THE INDIAN OCCULISTS. AT the Central Criminal Court, on Monday, before the Common Serjeant, the trial of the four Indian oculists, Heeri Shah, alias Kream Bocesh, Khair Deen, alias Cade, Shahah Bedean, and Karim Bakhsh, on an indictment charging them with a conspiracy to defraud, and with obtaining money by false pretences, in connection with operations for disease of the eye, was resumed for the sixth day. The Common Serjeant summed up with great detail. Dealing with the evidence called for the defence, his lordship observed that it could not be disputed but that the prisoners did have some knowledge of eye diseases, although their methods might have had # one hundred years ago. Still there was the fact, which had been deposed to by several witnesses, that the treatment used by the Indians had a beneficial effect, and had given satisfaction. It was evident that in some of the cases the Indians were not in a position to diagnose the diseases to the eyes from which some of the patients suffered, as, for instance, atrophy of the optic nerve, which required the use of the ophthalmoscope. No feeling of indignation or of displeasure was manifested against those people until the prosecution, when everybody seemed to rise in arms against them. The suggestion of jealousy on the part of the medical profession against these persons was of the wildest stretch of imagination which the learned counsel for the defence could ever have indulged in. All, he thought, would agree that the action which the society had taken was in the best interests of the community, and perfectly justified by the circumstances under, which the conduct of the prisoners presented itself. The responsibility of the decision of the conduct and behaviour of the men rested with the jury. Had the prosecution established that these men, either by their conduct or treatment, together with the other of circumstances connected with their proceedings, been guilty of conspiring to defraud, and had defrauded, by means of false representations. In this respect the jury had to say whether the prisoners wickedly and deliberately performed operations which they knew to be perfectly useless, and performed them with the full knowledge that they were unnecessary and cruel, and with the object of fraud. The jury retired to consider their verdict at fifteen minutes to one. After an absence of two hours they returned into court with a verdict of not guilty. The foreman added a rider to their verdict to the effect that they (the jury) deeply regretted that at present there existed no law which would prevent such persons, with the gross ignorance of the prisoners, from practising surgery.

3200812376,"GHASTLY MURDER OF A GOVERNESS IN A WOOD. BETWEEN five and eight o'clock on Friday evening a brutal murder was committed at a lone farmhouse in Lambridge Wood, about a mile and a half from Henley, the victim being Kate Dancy, governess and housekeeper for several years past in the family of Mr. Mash, a fruiterer, of Fulham-road, London, who resides at the farm part of the year. George Dawson, the farm-hand in charge, left Lambridge at five o'clock, when he says all was well. About eight o'clock two boys, who always sleep at the farmhouse, went there as usual, but failed to gain admittance, the house being locked up, although lights were burning in the rooms. The two boys waited until ten o'clock, and then returned to the home of their parents, about half a mile distant. Their parents informed Dawson, and he went to Lambridge with the boys. He found the house still looked up, and on making a search in the vicinity he found the body of Miss Dancy in the wood nearby with her head smashed in, the ears cut, and gashes on the neck. She was quite dead, and had evidently been murdered some hours previously. Word was at once sent to the police. Superintendent Keel was soon on the spot, and with a constable entered the house by a window. It soon became evident that the unfortunate woman was first attacked in the house, for there were signs of a struggle in the passage, blood splashes on the walls, and a brooch and hairpins on the floor. Just outside the door of the passage the police found a portion of a heavy cudgel, about an inch in diameter, and another part of it, as well as an iron poker, were found near the body, where it was evident by the state of the ground a second and prolonged struggle had taken place between the victim and her murderer. The police have not yet obtained any clue likely to lead to the arrest of the murderer. Miss Dancy was about twenty-six years of age, and is described as an accomplished young lady. She was the daughter of a farmer at Tunbridge Wells. Robbery appears to have been the motive, although nothing was touched in the house. Deceased's pocket was turned inside out; both doors were locked inside, but the sitting room window was open. An inquest was opened at Henley on Monday, on the body of the murdered lady, and a man of the name of Rathall was arrested during the day on suspicion of being concerned in the crime.","GHASTLY MUDEDR OF A GOVERNESS IS I i A WOOD. , yETrN five and eight o'clock on Friday evening a brutal murder was committed at a lone farmhouse in Lambridge Wood, about a mile and a half from Hen- ley, the victim being Kate Daccy, governess and housekeeper for several years past in the family of Mr. Mash, a fruiterer, of Falham-road, London, who resides at the farm part of the year.

3200812698,"SEQUEL TO A BREACH OF PROMISE. AT the Croydon Borough Police-court, John Joseph Leonard Cridland, a brewer's traveller, of Holmwood-road, South Norwood, was summoned by Miss Frances Hiscock, of Buxton-road, Croydon, who alleged that he was the father of her child, and asked that he might be ordered to contribute towards its support. Mr. E. M. Armstrong appeared for the complainant and Mr. Letchford for the defendant. Miss Frances Hiscock said the child in question, a boy, was born on August 22nd, 1893, and the defendant was the father. The letter produced, dated January 3rd, 1893, was in Cridland's handwriting. It read as follows: —""My Dear Franky, —After what you said on Saturday I suppose I must not come now, and therefore write to say I shall pay the expenses of this affair, but they must not exceed £10 or £12, as that is all I can afford; further, I will allow you £1 a month for life. If I am lucky I hope to allow you a little more, unless you should get married. —Yours very sincerely, LEN. Let me have a line at Catford tomorrow. Best wishes. I am sure all will be right in the end."" Cross-examined: When she first made the defendant's acquaintance she was adopting the name of Stanley for business purposes. By ""business"" she meant dressmaking. She still did dressmaking, but used no brass plate, her customers being recommended. Before coming to Croydon she lived at 92, Byne-road, Sydenham; that was when she first saw the defendant. She was standing at the window talking to her sister and smoking a cigarette. She always smoked a cigarette in the morning for indigestion. While there she was visited by Lieutenant Glossop, of the 17th Lancers, who was now in India with his regiment. She was not aware that there was no lieutenant of that name in the 17th Lancers, and that that regiment was not in India. She registered the child in the name of Hiscock. –I think you brought an action for breach of promise against the defendant, and that there is a judgment against him for £500 damages and costs? Yes–Have you had the money? Not a farthing. –Have you applied for it? My solicitor has, Mrs. Cridland, the defendant's wife, called upon her and insulted her by accusing her of impropriety with other men; but it was not true. Mr. Letchford: Were you indignant? Mr. Seale (chief clerk): I should think she was. (Laughter.) Witness said she was indignant. Re-examined: The defendant told her that he was a single man, and promised her marriage, and it was after making that promise that he seduced her. Mrs. Ann Cridland, who was sworn on the Old Testament, said she was the defendant's wife. When she called on the plaintiff she accused her of impropriety on the strength of what her husband had said, and she hung her head and shrugged her shoulders. She invited witness to stay to tea, but she did not accept the invitation. (Laughter.) After the trial witness received an anonymous letter card, which ran: “Find out why she left Hounslow, and appeal against the decision of the Court."" John Joseph L. Cridland, the defendant, was then called, and related how he saw the plaintiff, who was standing at her window smoking, beckon him. Thinking she wanted to order some beer– (laughter) –he went to the house. In about a minute she dressed and came It was in Beckenham-lane out, her sister egging her on, that he committed himself. He had given her presents. The Bench ordered the defendant to pay 5s. a week until the child is fourteen, and £2 19s, costs. ______________________________ HEAVY SENTENCE FOR WIFE BEATING.

She jumped out of bed, ran into the street, and called in Police-constable 238 D, in front of whom he again struck her a violent blow in the face, almost felling her. He threatened to murder his wife, and said he would do six months for her.

At the Croydon Borough Police-court, John Joseph Leonard Cridland, a brewer's traveller, of Holmwoodroad, South Norwood, was summoned by Miss Frances Hiscock, of Buxton-road, Croydon, who alleged that he was the father of her child, and asked that he might be ordered to contribute towards its support. Mr. E. M. Armstrong appeared for the complainant and Mr. Letchford for the defendant. Miss Frances Hiscock said the child in question, a boy, was born on August 22nd, 1893, and the defendant was the father. The letter produced, dated January 3rd, 1893, was in Cridland's handwriting. It read as follows: ""My Dear Franky, After what you said on Saturday I suppose I must not come now, and therefore write to say I shall pay the expenses of this affair, but they must not exceed £10 or £12. as that is all I can afford; further, I will allow you £1 a month for life. If I am lucky I hope to allow you a little more, unless you should get married. Yours very sincerely, Len. Let me have a line at Catford to morrow. Best wishes. I am sure all will be right in the end."" Cross-examined: When she first made the defendant's acquaintance she was adopting the name of Stanley for business purposes. By ""business"" she meant dressmaking. She still did dressmaking, but used no brass plate, her customers being recommended. Before coming to Croydon she lived at 92, Byne-road, Sydenham; that was when she first saw the defendant. She was standing at the window talking to her sister and smoking a cigarette. She always smoked a cigarette in the morning for indigestion. While there she was visited by Lieutenant Glossop, of the 17th Lancers, who was now in India with his regiment. She was not aware that there was no lieutenant of that name in the 17th Lancers, and that that regiment was not in India. She registered the child in the name of Hiscock. I think you brought an action for breach of promise against the defendant, and that there is a judgment against him for £500 damages and costs? Yes—Have you had the money? Not a farthing. Have you applied for it? My solicitor has, Mrs. Oridland, the defendant's wife, called upon her and insulted her by accusing her of impropriety with other men; but it was not true. Mr. Letchford: Were you indignant? Mr. Seale (chief clerk): I should think she was. (Laughter.) Witness said she was indignant. Re-examined: The defendant told her that he was a single man, and promised her marriage, and it was after making that promise that he seduced her. Mrs. Ann Cridland, who was sworn on the Old Testament, said she was the defendant's wife.

She invited witness to stay to tea, but she did not accept the invitation. (Laughter.) After the trial witness received an anonymous letter card, which ran: ""Find out why she left Hounslow, and appeal against the decision of the Court."" John Joseph L. Cridland, the defendant, was then called, and related how he saw the plaintiff, who was standing at her window smoking, beckon him. Thinking she wanted to order some beer—(laughter)—he went to the house. In about a minute she dressed and came out, her sister egging her on. It was in Beckenham-lane that he committed himself. He had given her presents. The Bench ordered the defendant to pay £5 a week until the child is fourteen, and £2 19s. costs. EAVY SENTENCE FOR WIFE BEATING.

After passing through St. James's Park they proceeded towards Hyde Park. On going under the archway near Hyde Park-corner the wheeler bounded, and this, he thought, startled the leader. They both commenced to gallop furiously, but all went well until they reached Albert Gate. At this place there was a considerable amount of traffic on the right side and a brougham on the left. Witness endeavoured to steer between them, but the coachman of the brougham pulled in the same direction, and they collided, and both witness and the deceased were thrown to the ground. He was partially stunned by the fall, and on recovering consciousness he saw some bystanders carrying Miss Patton-Bethune away. When the wheeler first became startled the groom got down to see what was the matter, but before he could do anything the horses became unmanageable, and the man was unable to remount. Witness had frequently driven tandem, but he had never driven the wheeler before. William Henry Cole, a porter, who witnessed the accident, stated that the dogcart collided with a post on the near side before it reached the brougham, and the deceased was thrown up in the air and fell on the ground on her head. Witness picked her up, and immediately conveyed her to St. George's Hospital.

Ernest Lansley, a farrier, of 3, Bendon Terrace, Bendon Road, Wandsworth, stated that on Monday night he was walking along a path way by the side of a field at the top of Kingswood Road, when a middle-aged gentleman called his attention to the deceased, who was lying groaning in the centre of the field, about thirty yards from the road. There was a great deal of blood about the man's head, und a butcher's knife was lying on the ground close by. When the witness arrived the man was apparently endeavouring to again get hold of the knife, and was stretching out his hand. towards it. He was bleeding profusely, and the witness, thinking he would attempt to further. injure himself, picked up the knife and threw it some distance off. A butcher's boy came up shortly afterwards, and the witness sent him for the police and a doctor, but the man died before the latter arrived. Police-constable Henry Searle, 210 V, said the deceased lived for about six minutes after he was discovered.

3200813774,"CROYDON. AT the borough police-court, Eliza Gillard, an elderly woman, was charged with refractory conduct and refusing to perform her allotted task at the Union Workhouse. Murdoch Mitchell, the labour superintendent, stated that the prisoner was admitted into the work house as a casual on Sunday night, and on the following morning she was set to clean some pannikins and spoons. This she refused to do without assistance, saying that she would prefer picking oakum. He afterwards found that she had been smoking, and she handed him a pipe. The master ordered the witness to give prisoner a pound of oakum. Witness told her that (Tuesday) morning her husband had left the house, and she threw the oakum into the road after picking about an ounce of it. The prisoner told the magistrates that she and her husband and child were obliged to leave their furnished lodgings, and being unable to obtain others they had to seek shelter in the casual wards. So far from doing no work she cleaned thirty-two spoons, eleven brass handles, and other things. She had to dress herself in a cold room with the windows wide open, and having a bad chest she asked the official to put her into a warm room. The wife of the labour superintendent said, ""You tramps will be wanting a fire directly."" As to smoking, her doctor had advised her to do so, but the pipe referred to belonged to another woman. Mitchell, recalled, said the prisoner was in a lavatory, but she was put into the oakum room to pick oakum. There was no fire in the room, nor was it heated. The prisoner was in there two hours without a fire. Prisoner: I asked to see the doctor, and you said I might have to wait till two o'clock. Mitchell, in answer to the Bench, said the floor of the oakum room was of concrete. Elizabeth Everton, a witness called by the prisoner, said she knew nothing of the latter until she asked her to fetch a policeman, ""because they were screwing her hands round the bars of the gate."" The prisoner said it was the first time they had been to the workhouse. Mr. Arnold Pyo-Smith (chairman) said the Bench felt that the prisoner was insubordinate, for if she went into the workhouse she must do as she was told. They thought, however, that she was not treated with the consideration that might have been shown her, being put in a cold room, and so on, and she would be discharged, Prisoner: Thank you, sir; they ought to be made to treat poor people better. ________________________________ THE TROUBLES OF A MUSICAL CLOWN. THE case of ""Camainada v. O'Gust"" came before his honour Judge Lumley Smith, Q.C., in the Westminster County Court, and was a claim for 50s., for scoring a waltz for the defendant, a musical clown at the Palace Theatre. The defendant admitted that the plaintiff took down a waltz which he whistled and scored it for him, but he said that was done as a friend, and besides that the plaintiff was to participate in the profits. His Honour said he did not think the work was done as a friend, and gave judgment for the amount claimed, with costs. The defendant asked for time to pay, as he had a large family. His Honour: What do you mean by a large family? A gentleman who acted as interpreter for the defendant replied that he had to keep his wife, four children, four brothers, and his mother. (Laughter.) Mr. Oliver, for the plaintiff, said his salary was £25 a week at the Palace. An order to pay by instalments was made. _________________________ A CONSTABLE'S FREAK. POLICE-CONSTABLE GEORGE ST.

3202426394,"THE DAGENHAM MURDER. It has already been stated that the grand jury at the Chelmsford Assizes ignored the bill against George Blewett for the murder of Clark, the policeman, as Dagenham, in the year 1846, the learned judge (Mr. Justice Willes), in his charge, having expressed a strong opinion that there was not sufficient corroboration of the evidence of the woman Page to render it probable that the petty jury would convict the prisoner if they should return a true bill. When the bill had been ignored, Mr. Sergeant Parry, who had been retained to defend the prisoner, applied to his lordship to make an order that he should be discharged, but Mr. Justice Willes declined to do so while the grand jury were sitting. Having shortly afterwards got through their business they were dismissed, and Sergeant Parry then renewed his application for the release of the prisoner. His lordship said that, now the grand jury were dismissed the prisoner might be discharged, and he at the same time said that he must state that it appeared to him that the magistrates of the petty sessions who had committed the prisoner for trial, had very properly performed their duty in so doing, and that as the case stood before then they had no alternative but to send the matter to be inquired into. The grand jury had then to exercise their discretion, and it appeared to him that upon the evidence laid before them, they had done quite right in ignoring the bill. The prisoner, George Blewitt, was shortly afterwards discharged from the gaol. There were some very extraordinary circumstances in connexion with the murder of the unfortunate policeman that will be interesting to be made public. It appears that on the night Clark lost his life the sergeant who had the charge of the beat where he was on duty, and who should have met him at certain spots during the night, had absented himself without leave, and when the murder was discovered and he was called upon to give evidence, he was placed in a very unpleasant position, and in order to clear himself he swore that he had met the deceased in the performance of his duty at a certain spot and at a particular hour, and he induced two other constables belonging to the division to come forward and give similar evidence. As the inquiry proceeded it became evident that these witnesses had spoken falsely, and at length one of them admitted that the statement he had made was false. The consequence of this was that a very strong impression was created in the minds of many persons that the unfortunate deceased had met his death at the hands of the sergeant, and this impression was strengthened to a certain extent by the fact, that upon inquiries being made, it turned out that Clark, who was a young man religiously inclined, had on several occasions accompanied the wife of the sergeant to chapel while the latter was on duty, and it was suggested that the murder was the result of jealousy. Nothing, however, transpired to justify any proceedings being taken upon this charge, and the sergeant and the two constables were committed to take their trials at the Chelmsford assizes upon a charge of wilful and corrupt perjury, and they were eventually convicted of that offence, and sentenced to seven years' transportation. Shortly after his conviction the sergeant went out of his mind, and has remained in that state ever since, and nothing more transpired relating to the murder until the woman Page made the statement which led to the committal of the prisoner Blewitt. It was the opinion of almost every one acquainted with the fact that, if the prisoner had been put upon his trial on the present occasion, he must have been acquitted, in which case he would have been altogether relieved from the charge, but by the course that has been taken, if any evidence should be obtained at a future time to confirm the evidence of the woman Page, it will still be competent to try him for the murder, so that it is not at all improbable that the interests of justice will still be vindicated in reference to this fearful crime.","I: sTHEIAGEEEArM MURDER.

3205317819,"FATAL OMNIBUS ACCIDENT. —THE BANKSIDE ROWING MATCH. —Mr. Joseph Payne held an inquest on Wednesday evening in St. Thomas's Hospital, on the body of Henry Joseph Read, aged ten, who was killed by being run over by an omnibus on the evening of Monday last, under the following circumstances: —From the evidence of several witnesses, it appeared that about a quarter to eight on the above evening, the deceased was seen to pass between a waggon and cart crossing London-bridge, and run across the road. In doing so, he fell down in front of the horses of an omnibus passing on the other side of the cart and waggon, and before the driver of the omnibus could pull up, both wheels passed over his loins. He got up without any assistance and walked to the footpath, where he asked a witness, named Kirby, to take him by the hand. The omnibus had stopped but a minute before to take up passengers, and was going in the direction of Bow en route to Brixton. The driver pulled up immediately, and it was the opinion of the witnesses that the deceased was not seen by him before the wheels passed over the body. In a few minutes the deceased was removed to the hospital, where, he died the same evening from the effects of the injuries. Mr. J. S. Read, of No. 14, St. Mary-at-hill, said the deceased was his son, and the last time he saw him alive was on Monday evening last, about a quarter past six o'clock. He wished to go over the water with witness's man, but he was refused permission.

3206190914,"HORRIBLE MUTILATION AT REIGATE. REIGATE, THURSDAY, AUGUST 19. —Yesterday morning the quiet village of Chepstow, Surrey, situate about six miles from Reigate, was thrown into a state of painful excitement, in consequence of a most alarming riot between a large number of English and Irish reapers, who reside in the lower part of that picturesque spot; and from the awful character of the injuries received by one of the men, named John M’Carthy, aged forty-five, his death is hourly expected. It appears that about mid-day on Wednesday, a party of reapers and their wives assembled at a public house called the White Hart, Chepstow, Surrey, where, after a short time, they commenced singing and drinking, until the man M'Carthy was called upon to sing a song, but be refused, and walked out, followed by a number of men and women, and when they crashed a spot a short stance from the public-house, one of the ringleaders, named George Fisher, told M'Carthy, that if he did not go back and sing a song, or pay for a pot of ale, he (Fisher) would ""cut his arm off with the fagging-hook."" M’Carthy refused and the next moment Fisher, who had the sharpened hook in his hand, raised the deadly weapon, and inflicted a most awful gark on M’Carthy’s head, who raised his left arm to defend himself, when Fisher again rushed forward, and gave him two mere frightful gashes across the left arm, which completely separated both bones of the limb, which was shockingly mutilated. By this time some assistance arrived, when the wounded man was carried into the White Hart public-house in a state of total insensibility, and bleeding most copiously from the several wounds. In the meantime the potman was despatched for the nearest surgeon, and in a short period one arrived, who promptly rendered every necessary aid in dressing the wounds. The left arm seemed to be completely amputated by the violence used, and the head of the unfortunate man had sustained several extensive lacerations, and various portions of the skull had been shaved all by the weapon used by the man Fisher. At a later period of the day the unfortunate man was in such a state of exhaustion, arising from the severe hemorrhage consequent upon the wounds, that it was deemed necessary to make some arrangement for the poor fellow’s removal to Guy's Hospital. It was, therefore, thought best to place him in a carriage at the Reigate station, and convey him with all cate to that institution, while place he reached at eight o'clock last evening. He was immediately forwarded to the accident ward, where he was at once seen by Mr. Hinton, the house-surgeon, who remained with him for several hours during the night. The man (Fisher) was, soon for the murderous affair, taken into custody, with the other ringleaders, and removed in charge of several active others to the county gaol, Reigate. This morning the prisoner George Fisher, Ann Fisher, his wife, and others, were brought before John Currie, Esq., of Gatton, Surrey, one of the magistrates for the county. Mrs. White, the landlady of the White Hart public-house, and several important witnesses, swore positively to seeing the prisoner Fisher strike M’Carthy on the head and left arm several times with the instrument called the ""fagging hook,"" and to using other violence. —The magistrate, upon receiving information that the unfortunate man M'Carthy was in a very precarious condition, proceeded by railway to the London-bridge terminus, and from thence to the accident ward of Guy's Hospital, to take the depositions of the injured man. GUY'S HOSPITAL. —On Thursday evening, at half-past six o'clock, John Currie, Esq., magistrate of Reigate, and his chief clerk, proceeded to the accident ward, where they were introduced to the wounded man. The prisoners Fisher and his wife were present in the custody of two officers. The wounded man, M'Carthy, on being sworn, gave a very clear account of the transaction, but he could not swear positively that it was the prisoner. He was sure it was a man who cut him first on the head, and then on the left arm. The man was dressed like the prisoner. He (M’Carthy) had nothing in his hand when the riot commenced. The man who inflicted the injuries threw the hook at him, which he picked up, but at that time he was so week that he fell from lows of blood. M’Carthy, in answer to the magistrate, said, ""I never used any violence, nor did I strike any one in defence. I left my fagging hook in the field where I had been at work."" The prisoner having put a few questions to the man M’Carthy, which did not shake his evidence in the slightest degree, Mr. G. Hinton, the house-surgeon, was next called, and said that M'Carthy had received very extensive incised wounds on the back and top of the head, and two wounds on the left arm, separating both bones near the elbow. He was in a very precarious state, but at present was going on as well as could be expected. The evidence of the several witnesses was the read over by the clerk, after which she prisoners were formally remanded to Kingston Gaol until Monday next.","HORRIBLE MUTILATION AT REIGATE RmIGosrx, TunrnsDr, AuGusa ] 9-Yesterday morning the quiet village of Chepstow, Surrey, situate about six miles from Reigate, was thrown insto a state of painful excitement, is consequence of a most alarming riot between a large number of English and Irish reapers, who reside in the lower part of that picturesque spot; and, from the awful character of the injuries received by one of the men, named John M'Carthy, aged ortN-five, his death is hourly expected.

Mr. Wallack appeared and utterly failed. Mr. Webster offered every inducement to Mr. Wallack to cancel the engagement without success. Mr. Wallack subsequently committed various breaches in the rules, and in particular by not attending the preliminary meeting of the company for the season 1851 and 1852, but Mr. Webster being absent from England, and not being informed of such breach being committed, Mr. Wallack was paid a week's salary subsequent to such breach by the treasurer. Mr. Webster, on being informed of the breach, discharged Mr. Wallack, and an action was brought for arrears of salary, and it was objected by Mr. Wallack that the breach was condoned by the payment of the week's salary. At the trial it was intimated to Mr. Webster's advisers that Mr. Wallack would compromise, and offered to abandon all claims on payment of 500l, but 300l, was offered and accepted. —This being a virtual abandonment of an engagement considerably above 1,000l. in value, the compromise was evidently an advantageous arrangement for Mr. Webster, and was literally a verdict in Mr. Webster's favour.

3206201407,"CHILD MURDER AND MUTILATION. On Tuesday, considerable excitement prevailed in Peckham and its vicinity from the discovery of the body of a female child in the house of Mr. Whitby, a highly respectable inhabitant of James- street, Commercial-road, Peckham, which had undergone the most extraordinary mutilation by the inhuman mother. It appears that on or about the 16th instant, a young woman, named Mercy Steer, servant to Mr. Whitby, seemed to be in very ill-health, and her mistress conceived that all was not right. She, however, left her service on the 20th inst., without any elucidation taking place, and proceeded to her native village, a place called Billinghurst, near Petworth, in the county of Sussex. Having there continued in an ill state of health she found it necessary to obtain medical advice, and the result of which was, that she was found to have been recently delivered of a child. Giving no satisfactory account of this, the circumstance was communicated to Mr. Hay, one of the churchwardens of Billinghurst, who, having ascertained that Mary Steer had been in service at Peckham, a communication was at once forwarded to Mr. Superintendent Lund, of the P division, who placed the matter in the hands of the police, who proceeded to the house of Mr. Whitby, for the purpose of making an examination. On searching the chamber which had been occupied by the woman Steer, there at first appeared no indications of any child birth having recently taken place. A closer inspection, however, showed that the sheets, blankets, and bedding, had been recently washed, with a view to remove any stains, but on the pillows there were some visible traces of blood. A further search showed some marks on the boards of the floor, to obliterate which, some evident, though ineffectual, attempts had been made. A closer investigation brought to light a piece of bedside carpeting, saturated with unequivocal marks of a recent child-birth. This discovery led to a more searching examination, and after removing the pan of the water-closet, the right hand of an infant was discovered on the top of the soil. Proceeding further in the examination, the various fragments of the body of a newly-born female child were brought forth, but which had been separated into so many minute portions, as to be almost calculated to destroy all traces of the previous existence of any human body. The object of this mutilation, it would seem, was to force the respective portions through the soil pipe, for which purpose the skull had been divided longitudinally, and the vertebræ had undergone a similar process. The hands had been amputated at the wrists, and the feet at the ankles, the arms at the elbows, the thighs at the hips, and the abdomen divided into several particles. As a matter of course, the heart, spleen, and other portions of the intestines were also subdivided. From a cursory view it would appear that the child was born alive, and must therefore have been subjected to horrid mutilation by the inhuman mother. The woman Mercy Steer is now under the surveillance of the Sussex constabulary, and when sufficiently restored to health will be brought to London, in order to undergo the necessary judicial inquiry.","CHILD MURDER AND MUTILATION.,On Tuesday, considerable excitement prevailed in Feckham and its vicinity from the discovery of the body of a female child in the house of Mr. Whitby, a highly respectable inhabitant of James. street, Commercial-road, Peckham, which had undergone the most extraordinary mutilation by the inhuman mother.

On searching the chamber which had been occupied by the woman Steer, there at first appeared no indications of any child birth having recently taken place. A closer inspection, however, showed that the sheets, blankets, and bedding, had been recently washed, with a view to remove any stains, but on the pillows there were some visible traces of blood. A further search showed some marks on the boards of the floor, to obliterate which, some evident, though ineffectual, attempts had been made. A closer investigation brought to light a piece of bedside carpeting, saturated This discovery led to a more searching examination, and after removing the pan of the water-closet, the right hand of an infant was discovered on the top of the soil. Proceeding further in the examination, the various fragments of the body of a newly-born female child were brought forth, but which had been separated into so many minute portions, as to be almost calculated to destroy all traces of the previous existence of any human body. The object of this mutilation, it would seem, was to force the respective portions through the soil pipe, for which purpose the skull had been divided logitudinally, and the vertebrae had undergone a similar process. The hands had been amputated at the wrists, and the feet at the ankles, the arms at the elbows, the thighs at the hips, and the abdomen divided into several particles. As a matter of course, the heart, spleen, and other portions of the intestines were also subdivided. From a cursory view it would appear that the child was born alive, and must therefore have been subjected to horrid mutilation by the inhuman mother. The woman Mercy Steer is now under the surveillance of the Sussex constabulary, and when sufficiently restored to health will be brought to London, in order to",0.017065,0.092937,0.029165,0.031599
3206203053,"THE ITALIAN IMPOSTOR AND BIGAMIST. Alexander Borromeo, alias Dr. Tucker, alias Marco de St. Hilaire, &c., the Irish Italian impostor, who lately figured in the ""Conference"" hoax, was brought before Mr. Hall, at Bow-street, by habeas corpus, to answer a charge of bigamy preferred by the society for the Protection of Women. Mr. Sleigh stated that the present charge related to one only of several acts of bigamy which had been undoubtedly committed by the prisoner. The second marriage took place at the famous Gretna green, to which a young lady, overcome by his blandishments, had been induced to accompany the prisoner, by whom, after she became the mother of a child, she was cruelly deserted. The first marriage in the name of St. Hilaire, with Mary Ann Sadler, was plainly proved; but the prisoner begged the magistrate to write to France. He would then ascertain that Hilaire was in a government situation there. He (prisoner) had never been to England until after 1842. The parties were mistaken. Hilaire was a well-known political character. The effrontery with which this statement was made appeared to take the witnesses by surprise. Mr. Sadler, the brother of the first wife, asserted that he knew the prisoner perfectly well, and the prisoner knew him. Anna Maria Froggatt deposed that she first made prisoner's acquaintance at Preston, in 1847, when he induced her to leave her home, and accompany him to Gretna-hall, in Scotland, where they were married, according to the ceremony observed there, and pronounced by the Rev. Mr. Linton, the priest, to be legally man and wife. The prisoner left her, with one child (a little girl), in 1851, and she had never seen him since till that day, in the court. She had to seek her own bread by working in the millinery trade. The prisoner: I assure you it is all a mistake. I know nothing of these people. To save trouble, if you will not write to the French government, I may as well plead guilty, and reserve to myself the right of prosecuting these witnesses for perjury. The Scotch certificate, showing Miss Froggatt's marriage with Marco Emile de St. Hilaire, was here produced, and Mr. R. Stuart, barrister, of 8, Old square, Lincoln's-inn, having proved it to be a legal marriage, the prisoner was committed for trial.","I THE ITALIAN IMPOSrOR AND BIGAMIST. .4 lexander Boromeo, alias Dr. lhcker, alias Afarce de St. Bilaire, Sc., the Irish Italian impostor, who lately figured in the "" Conference"" hoax, was brought before lMdr.

On Wednesday morning, the jury met to resume their inquiry at the New Globe tavern, Bow-road, into the death of an infant, about three weeks old, named Philip Yorath, illegitimate child of Miss Elizabeth Yorath, sister of a highly respectable surgeon of that name, practising at Newport, in Monmouthshire. The investigation arose in consequence of several anonymous letters forwarded to the Bishop of London, signed ""A Parishioner,"" reflecting on the moral conduct of the Rev. J.

MANSION-HOUSE A SAD CASE OF LUNACY. —George Delamotte, a man of seventy-five, having the manners and appearance of a gentleman, despite his very humble attire, and described as a lieutenant on half-pay in the East Middlesex militia, was charged with assaulting Charles Broad, of No. 87, Fenchurch-street, and threatening to stab him with a carving-knife. —The complainant said that on the afternoon, of Saturday, the prisoner came to his luncheon-bar and called for a glass of ale, which he drank and paid for. He helped himself to some bread and cheese while witness's back was turned, and then called for another glass of ale, for which he paid. Taking offence at being asked to pay for the bread and cheese, he went to the further end of the counter, and, taking up a carving-knife which lay there, threatened to rip him up, using at the same time an opprobrious expression. He then aimed a blow at him with the knife, but a gentleman who came in at the moment seized the prisoner by the elbows from behind, and prevented him doing further mischief. He then dropped the knife, but afterwards, on a policeman being called in to take him into custody, struck the com plainant a blow in the face. He was quite sober. — The back of the prisoner's head was covered with blood. On being asked to account for the wound, he said that a man at the police-station, thinking he (the prisoner) was about to strike him, seized him, and threw him on his back, thereby cutting his head. The hole, he added, into which he was put at the station was foul almost beyond endurance. He had lived with Turks and brigands for years, but was never in so loathsome a place as that in which he had spent the last two nights; it was really a disgrace to the country. He was very subject to fits, and hoped the court would be moderate and gentle with him. On being asked if he had any friends, he replied he had plenty in different parts of the country, but did not know whether any of them wore in town. He himself resided near Windsor, where he was well known to many officers and gentlemen. He was reminded by the court that he had given an address in Deptford, and was asked to write down his place of residence, which he did. Resuming his story, he apologised for not being able to remember the name of his land-lord, as one of his fits was coming on him then, but the address he had given would find him, for he was very well known there. He could not help laughing, he said, when he thought of the matter. He came up to town on Saturday, as he had not a penny, to see his broker, who gave him some money and told him to call again. That sum he meant to last him until his half-pay was due. He could not remember anything wrong he had done. The complainant, as he was leaving his house, asked him to apologies for what he had done to his wife, but he had done nothing to his wife, and he was not in the habit of apologizing when he had committed no offence. On being asked by the bench if any surgeon had seen the wound on his head, ""Oh, no,"" said he, with a patronizing air, ""I am my own doctor; I have had my brains knocked out once."" —The prisoner, who was evidently deranged, was about to add something, when the alderman, stopping him, gave directions for his being placed under the care of the prison surgeon until inquiries could be made respecting him. —The constable in charge of the prisoner explained that he had behaved with great violence at the Bow lane station, and had probably received the wound in his head in an attempt to restrain him.

OUTRAGEOUS USE OF A POKER. —Thomas William Akenhead, a young man of about nineteen, was charged with having on the 4th instant committed a very murderous assault upon Samuel Lee, aged about forty, who has been ever since confined in King's College hospital. —The case had been remanded from time to time owing to the inability of the complainant to leave the hospital, the injuries inflicted being, in the opinion of the medical attendants, of a very dangerous character. —The prosecutor stated that he lived in lodgings at 50, Charles-street, Drury-lane, and was by profession the proprietor of a travelling van. The prisoner lodged in the same house, occupying an adjoining room. On the night in question witness had left a half-crown on the mantelpiece, which the prisoner had been seen to take away. Witness asked him for it, saying simply, ""Come, Tom, give me that half-crown you took from the chimney-piece."" He declined to give it up, swore that he had not had it, and used very violent and threatening language. A quarrel ensued between them, during which the prisoner seized a poker and aimed a blow at witness's head, which instantly felled him to the ground and left him insensible. — Police-constable 169 F deposed that he was on the spot a few minutes after the occurrence, and found the complainant insensible and bleeding profusely from a dreadful wound in the head. He thought both the prisoner and complainant had been drinking. He took complainant to the hospital, and had brought him from there that morning, the surgeon desiring that he should be taken back directly after the examination, as he was still too ill to leave the hospital. The assault was committed at about twelve o'clock at night, and a man named Jaques, who had given evidence respecting it at the first examination, had declined to attend on the present examination. —The prisoner said he did not inflict the wounds on the complainant's head. He had been spending the evening with complainant, and they had been drinking freely together. After this the complainant came into his (prisoner's) room, and accused him of the theft; and when he refused to leave the room, prisoner put him out by force, and he fell. —The case was again remanded; the complainant being taken back to King's-college-hospital.","POLICE INTELLIGENCE.

3206213295,"ATTEMPTED MURDER IN OXFORD-STREET. Ruth Elsden, an unfortunate woman, was charged at Marlborough-street police-court, with attempting to murder Thomas Foskett, potman, at the Duke of York, in Union-street, Oxford-street. There is little doubt the prisoner was actuated to commit the act from a feeling of revenge, she having, in October last, been charged at this court with two soldiers for an assault on Foskett, when she was committed for seven days in default of paying a fine, and, from the threat she made use of, there is reason to believe that she intended to take Foskett's life. Joseph Reed, 60 D, said he was called to the Duke of York, and saw the prisoner there, and the man Foskett was sitting on a form bleeding from the head copiously. The prisoner, said, ""Look here, fatty (the constable is a stout man); so help me God, I did it, and intended to do so."" then asked where the knife was, and the landlord said he had put it away, but afterwards gave it to him. The knife (a large clasp one) produced is the same. It had blood on it at the time. The prisoner had been drinking, but she well knew what she was about. He then took Foskett to the Middlesex hospital. He went to the hospital that morning and received the certificate produced.

Mrs. Emma Lawton said she was the wife of the deceased, and lived at 38, Great Windmill-street. She was not at home when the circumstance occurred. She left home about eight o'clock in the evening. Her husband was out then. He had been very irregular in his habits in consequence of drink, and they had not spoken for nearly a fortnight. She had previously prevented him destroying himself. He was a volunteer, and attempted to shoot himself with his rifle. He belonged to the 14th Middlesex. She returned home about twenty minutes past one, and went up to her room, where she found him lying on the floor with the rifle across his legs. He was dressed. She called the landlady. Mrs. Jane Crow said she resided in the same house as the deceased and his wife, they being her lodgers. She had been at home all the evening, but had not heard the discharge of firearms. Mrs. Lawton called her up, and witness said, ""Perhaps he is only asleep,"" but Mrs. Lawton said, ""No; he is dead, for his face is cold."" Witness went up with the other lodgers, and one of them opened the room door and then slammed it to, and they called the police. Dr. Harris came in about five minutes.

Alexander Thompson, 175 C, said that in consequence of hearing screaming he went to the door of 38, Windmill-street, and knocked.

He had seen a quantity of sovereigns in the possession of Police-constable Abbott that morning, and he could swear that some of them were his property (the bag of gold was here produced, and the witness selected a sovereign with a peculiar mark upon it.) He had often seen that sovereign whilst counting his money. Police-constable Abbott stated that he met the prisoners in Snow-hill, and searched them. He found 2961. 16s. 6d. on Edwards, who said he could not account for his possession of the money, but if the officer had more right to it than he had, he (the officer) had better take it. Other evidence tending to connect the prisoners with the robbery was given, and they were committed for trial. Mrs. Brown, A. Widow at Last.—The husband of the woman Brown, whose anxiety to become a widow, it will be remembered, led to her examination before the Plymouth magistrates a short time since on a charge of endeavouring to cause her husband's death, died at his house, in Milton Street, on Sunday morning last.",0.066265,0.237327,0.026104,0.048387
3206225571,"SINGULAR CHARGE OF ROBBERY. On Wednesday, at the Middlesex sessions, Sarah Higgins, nineteen, servant, was charged with stealing three rings and other articles the property of Benjamin Lewis Franklin. This was an important case. The prosecutor lived at No. 44, Albemarle-street, but had been living at 13, Bruton-street, where the prisoner, was in the capacity of a general servant. About the end of last month, he had occasion to look into his jewel-case, and found it nearly empty. Three or four rings, a chain, shawls, and dresses, had been stolen. On the 28th of June he saw the prisoner, and asked her whether she was not ashamed of herself to look him in the face after having stolen his property. She said, ""Oh, you gave them to me;"" and when he asked her, ""Why?"" she said, ""Because you locked the door on me, and took liberties with me."" This the prosecutor most stoutly denied, and declared upon his oath that he never took the slightest liberty with her, and would not have parted with the things she was charged with stealing, because they belonged to his late wife. The prisoner sold the things to Mrs. Mengedoht who keeps the house, and who, when examined, deposed to having met the prisoner upon one occasion on the stairs, apparently coming out of the prosecutor's room, and looking very flushed and flurried, with her hair disheveled. Mr. Benjamin Lewis Franklin was examined, and denied having ever taken any familiarities with the prisoner. He said she had a master key, with which she could enter his rooms. He described the articles (family relics) which he had lost, and said the prisoner was never in his room with a turned key, nor did he ever take any improper liberties with her. He had asked her about her sweetheart one Sunday when she wished to clean his room in order to go out early. After further evidence and examination of witnesses, Mr. Ribton made a very lengthy address to the jury on behalf of the prisoner. The jury returned a verdict of ""Not guilty."" Mr. L. Lewis, in the absence of Mr. Sleigh, said it was right to mention that the prisoner had made a similar charge against a previous employer, and he could prove it by witnesses. She had also charged a gentleman at the Hammersmith police-court with an indecent assault. It was also stated that prisoner had been discharged from a situation at Notting-hill for pilfering, and that she had frequently shown the locket alluded to. The assistant judge remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, but that it had nothing to do with the case at present decided by the jury, though it must be a great satisfaction to Mr. Franklin to have beard these statements. The prisoner was then discharged.","SINGIULA CHARGE OF ROBBERY.

3206228605,"ALLEGED MURDER IN FIFESHIRE. On Saturday, a man named William Williamson, surfaceman, was apprehended and taken to Cupar by Captain Bremner, chief constable of Fifeshire, on a charge of having murdered Edward Glenning, a # in the service of Mr. Alexander Hunter, farmer, in the farms of Fordell-hill and Strathburn. Fordell and Strathburn are two farms in the vicinity of the village of Leuchars. It appears that on Friday afternoon the deceased, along with Williamson and a number of farm servants, had been at a sale of stock on the farm at Strathburn. In the afternoon a quarrel arose between Williamson and deceased regarding a dog which the former had. Glenning had it is stated, threatened to strike or kick the dog, upon which Williamson remarked that he might as well strike himself as his dog. Whether the deceased carried his threat to strike the dog into effect is not known, but the men soon afterwards closed, and a wrestle took place. At the conclusion of the wrestling, Williamson left the company of Glenning, but was followed by him. The result was that Williamson got possession of a stone of considerable size, and striking Glenning with it on the head, felled him to the ground. Having remained on the ground for some time in a state of unconsciousness, Glenning was lifted by his comrades and taken to a house in the vicinity, where he had his head bathed. This occurred seven o'clock; and Glenning was so far recovered that he, along with his companions, left the house with the intention of going home. They had not proceeded far, however, when Glenning lay down on the road, at the side of a wall between St. Fort and Leuchars. There the two men who accompanied Glenning left him lying. At ten o'clock they returned, and found him in the same place, breathing heavily, and apparently in a sound sleep. Their efforts to rouse him proved ineffectual, and they again left him lying. On leaving they went to his house, which was about half a mile away, and told his wife what had happened, but no efforts were made to have him removed to a more comfortable place. Nothing further transpired till about five o'clock on Saturday morning, when one of Glenning’s companions of the previous evening went to the place and found him dead. An alarm was immediately given, and Dr. Constable, of Leuchars was sent for. On his arrival, he had the body removed to the farm steading of Strathburn. Captain Bremner was also informed of the circumstances, and brought with him from Cupar, Dr. Bonsar, who, along with his professional brother, made post-mortem examination of the body, which ended is an opinion that death resulted from the injury Glenning had received from the stone, the skull having been fractured. Captain Bremner apprehended Williamson on a charge of having murdered Glenning, and had him conveyed to Cupar, where on Saturday night he was examined before Sheriff Taylor, and stated that decensed had ill-used him, and that he has endeavoured to get away from him. Glenning, who was a stout man, about thirty-four years of age, was married, and leaves a wife and one, the latter about three weeks old. Williamson is about twenty years of age, unmarried, has no parents, and belongs to the north west of Elle. He was on Saturday committed to Cupar prison for further examination.","~&EP URDERIN FIFESHI~ 4k..,~v~a an na Wi wi I 1~~~~~~- -1-+ t'otaY'en Sthejsrspr-e-headed and tealenno, upar Fyo iteloal ""er chief conist5 h ofe ab ifsrl e of On a ;PW 10llrefliO. muirdered Edward Glam'ing, a oage. th ee~ f hail Jr. AloxanderHunter, farmer, iheserdf a 0 0trathbur Sr I the urn.

3206230154,"ACTION FOR LIBEL AGAINST THE ""STANDARD."" RISK ALLAH V. JOHNSTONE AND ANOTHER. —This was an action (tried in the Court of Queen's Bench yesterday morning) against the proprietor of the Standard newspaper for a libel contained in a leading article, published in the Standard shortly after the trial of the plaintiff at Brussels, on the alleged charges of murder and forgery. Mr. Baker Greene said that it would be mere affectation to infer that the gentlemen of the jury were ignorant of the case which had just terminated and in which the plaintiff in the present action had obtained a verdict. The present case, however, was a totally different one, the onus being thrown on the defendants, who were the proprietor and publisher of the Standard, Evening Standard, and Herald. The defendants did not deny the libel; they admitted it, and had placed four distinct pleas on the record. In the first place they pleaded that the libels were inserted without malice; secondly, that they were inserted without gross negligence; thirdly, that before the action was commenced, they inserted an ample apology; and, fourthly, for the damages which the plaintiff had sustained they had paid 20s. into court as compensation. If the jury were of opinion that the defendants did not establish any one of those pleas, it would be their duty to return a verdict for the plaintiff. Having stated the issue involved, the learned counsel proceeded to explain the facts of the case and the libels complained of. He said that the plaintiff had never traded on his reputation, and even at the present time he was perfectly prepared, if the defendants would withdraw the imputations which they had made on the plaintiff, to discontinue the action. Mr. Coleridge said the defendants had already done so in the fullest possible way, and they thought that quite sufficient; they had corrected every point on which the plaintiff had requested correction in his own words. He was quite willing on behalf of the defendants that a juror should be withdrawn. —Mr. Baker Greene could not assent to that course. A copy of the apology which the plaintiff had de sired should be inserted was put in and read. The letters of the defendants admitting the libel were also put in. This was the case for the plaintiff. Mr. Coleridge addressed the jury on behalf of the defendants, and said he left the issue with the greatest confidence in the hands of the jury. The learned judge summed up and the jury returned a verdict for the defendants.","ACTION FOR LIBEL AGAINST THE if *, ""STANDARD"".. i _S xIsl PELAS V.

3206232666,"THE WIFE MURDER AT HARROW. At the Central Criminal court, on Wednesday, Louis Midson, 52, victualler, was charged with the wilful murder of his wife, Bertha Midson, by shooting her in the parish of Harrow. This was a case of a melancholy character, and the facts will be fresh in the recollection of our readers. The prisoner kept publichouse called the Chequers, in the neighbourhood of Uxbridge and he had been married to the deceased for several years at the time the horrible occurrence took place, which was on the 6th of June last. It appeared that upon that day the prisoner and the deceased had had some altercation, that the latter was the worse for liquor at the time, and according to the evidence the latter was ""nagging"" at the prisoner, and annoying him in every possible manner. About 12 o'clock the prisoner said that he would go upstairs and shave himself, and the deceased said that he might cut his throat if he pleased. The deceased went upstairs after him, and in the course of a very few minutes two reports of firearms were heard. Upon the potman and nephew of the prisoner going upstairs to the bedroom, they found the deceased lying upon the floor dead, and the prisoner was lying wounded in an adjoining room, and upon the nephew asking him what he had done, he replied ""I could not help it. She drove me to do it."" A revolver was found lying close to the prisoner, and it appeared that he had discharged one of the chambers at his wife, and caused her death by that shot, and had then discharged another at himself, but the injury to him was of a trifling character. It was elicited in cross-examination that the parties had been married 28 years, and that the prisoner was uniformly kind to the deceased, but, on her part, she was continually annoying and abusing him, and that she was in the habit of getting intoxicated, and when in that condition made use of the most foul and disgusting language to the prisoner. Mr. Sleigh, upon these facts, made an earnest appeal to the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and he urged upon them that under all the circumstances they would be quite justified in finding him guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter. —A great many highly respectable witnesses were called to speak to the character of the prisoner, and they all described him as a humane and kind-hearted man. —The jury, after a short deliberation, found the prisoner ""Guilty"" of manslaughter, committed under excessive provocation, and they at the same time strongly recommended him to mercy on account of that provocation and his previously uniformly good conduct to his wife. —Prisoner was sentenced to five years' penal servitude.

3206232852,"A PRISONER'S ADDRESS TO THE JUDGE. At the Gloucester assizes, on Thursday, Ellen Tipper, who had been convicted on Wednesday of breaking open a box and stealing 30l., and who had also been previously convicted at Worcester assizes, was brought up before Mr. Justice Smith for sentence. —The prisoner, who was well-dressed, and had altogether an appearance of respectability, begged to be allowed to address a few observations to his lordship before he proceeded to award her punishment. She then, with some considerable feeling, addressed the judge. After alluding to her former conviction, she said she afterwards went to live with a young man now living in Gloucester, who afterwards slighted her. By the advice of the young man's master she went home, and then he wrote to her and said he should give her up. The prisoner went on in an impassioned manner as follows: —My lord, I can't express to you the bitterness of treatment I experienced from the young man after that I got a situation, but when they came to know that I had been living with the young man, they cast me out of doors. My lord, it is only through an all-wise Providence that I am here now. I concealed myself two days, and I took poison. My lord, I had not a farthing in my pocket, and I had nowhere to go to. They turned me out of doors. I tried my best to give satisfaction, but I was turned out of doors. I had no friends, and I did not know which way to turn. I had no one to look to, but the Lord God Almighty. He was my only friend. He has been with me, and I now well know the goodness of His hand. I hope this will be a warning to me and to others around me never to be led away by people that are older than themselves, and who ought to know better. I hope that the same Almighty who has forgiven me the sins I have committed—for during the time that I have been in prison I have prayed earnestly, and He has heard me—I hope He will send you, my lord, a kind heart to pass as light a punishment as you can on a poor and unfortunate girl. During the latter part of the prisoner's “speech” sobs were audible in several parts of the Court, and at its close the prisoner leant forward on the rail of the dock, and burying her face in her handkerchief appeared to be crying bitterly. —The judge then proceeded to pass sentence. She had, said his lordship, been convicted four times. It was easy enough to say that she was penitent, but no one would believe in her penitence until she showed it by her good conduct. He doubted whether he ought not to sentence her to penal servitude, but would give her another chance by sentencing her to eight months' imprisonment.","A PrIOiNER's AbDa1SS TO THE JUDGE.

At the Gloucester assizes, on Thursday, Ellen Tipper, who had been convicted on Wednesday of breaking open a box and stealing 30%, and who had also been previously convicted at Worcester assizes, was brought up before Mr. Justice Smith for sentences. The prisoner, who was well-dressed, and had altogether an appearance of respectability, begged to be allowed to address a few observations to his lordship before he proceeded to award her her punishment. She then, with some considerable feeling, addressed the judge. After alluding to her former conviction, she said she afterwards went to live with a young man now living in Gloucester, who afterwards slighted her. By the advice of the young man's master she went home, and then he wrote to her and said he should give her up. The prisoner went on in an impassioned manner as follows:—My lord, I can't express to you the bitterness of treatment I experienced from the young man after that. I got a situation, but when they came to know that I had been living with the young man, they cast me out of doors. My lord, it is only through an all-wise Providence that I am here now. I concealed myself two days, and I took poison. My lord, I had not a farthing in my pocket, and I had nowhere to go to. They turned me out of doors. I tried my best to give satisfaction, but I was turned out of doors. I had no friends, and I did not know which way to turn. I had no one to look to, but the Lord God Almighty. He was my only friend. He has been with me, and I now well know the goodness of His hand. I hope this will be a warning to me and to others around me never to be led away by people that are older than themselves, and who ought to know better. I hope that the same Almighty who has forgiven me the sins I have committed—for during the time that I have been in prison I have prayed earnestly, and He has heard me—I hope He will send you, my lord, a kind heart to pass as light a punishment as you can on a poor and unfortunate girl. During the latter part of the prisoner's ""speech"" sobs were audible in several parts of the Court, and at its close the prisoner leant forward on the rail of the dock, and burying her face in her handkerchief appeared to be crying bitterly. The judge then proceeded to pass sentence. She had, said his lordship, been convicted four times. It was easy enough to say that she was penitent, but no one would believe in her penitence until she showed it by her good conduct. He doubted whether he ought not to sentence her to penal servitude, but would give her another chance by sentencing her to eight months' imprisonment.",0.037107,0.127273,0.004922,0.018182
3206232856,"HORRIBLE MURDER AT PENDLETON. The body of a young woman was found in the Bolton and Manchester canal at Pendleton on Monday night, and a post-mortem examination of the body, which has since been made, seems to show that a brutal murder has been committed, preceded by outrage of an extremely atrocious nature. At an inquest opened at the King's Arms inn, Eccles, on Tuesday evening, the body was identified by two women, who had known deceased, as that of Kate Macdonald, a young woman who was employed in the throstle department of Sir E. Armitage's mill at Pendleton about last Christmas. Her mother was for several years housekeeper to Thomas Rudman, at Bacup. The body was seen floating in the canal near Strawberry-road bridge, Pendleton, on Monday night by Mrs. Sarah Broughton, of Pendleton. On Tuesday Mr. Davis, surgeon, made a post-mortem examination of the body. Externally there were two cuts on the face, one very deep; the upper part of one thigh was contused; and there was much effusion of blood beneath the skin about the lower part of the abdomen. Both arms were fractured, one in two places; the right collar-bone was dislocated; and five or six of the upper ribs on both sides were broken, fragments of which penetrated the lungs and large vessels. The internal and external injuries in the region of the abdomen were of a shocking character, and indicated the brutal nature of the treatment to which the poor creature had been subjected before death. The surgeon was of opinion that the deceased was killed before being put into the water, from the fact that there was no water in the stomach, nor was the brain congealed. There was a considerable effusion of blood under the scalp on each side, but the brain was not injured. From appearances he thought the deceased could not have led a very immoral life. The police being unable to discover where or how the deceased had lived since about Christmas last, the inquest was adjourned to the 20th inst.","HORRIBLE MURDER AT PENDLETON.

The mass proved to be the burst boiler, weighing several tons. A body subsequently came to the surface, which proved to be that of the stoker Williams. His head was completely blown off by the explosion, showing that death must have been instantaneous. The body of the master, Mr. Evans, has not yet been recovered.

3206233243,"ALLEGED MURDER AT SALFORD. On Thursday an inquest was held at Salford respecting the death of James Burns, a mason, aged 30, who died on Tuesday morning under circumstances tending very much to prove that he has been the victim of a murderous outrage. Recently the deceased had been employed, along with other masons—non-unionists—in the erection of a gas-tank in Liverpool street, Salford, and was frequently threatened and molested in going to and from his work. On Monday afternoon Burns was in a publichouse in Regent-road, and was seen in conversation with some men—masons, it would appear, from the description given. There were three men, and Burns, seemingly wishful to leave then, was observed to walk rapidly from the house. He was followed, overtaken, and in broad daylight, in the presence of a crowd of spectators, was knocked down, kicked, and finally killed by one of his assailants, more brutal than the remainder, taking hold of the poor fellow's hair and literally smashing his head upon the flags. No one, with the exception of a female, interfered, although a soldier is stated to have been an unconcerned spectator throughout. Having left Burns in a state of insensibility, and bathed in blood, the men walked quietly away, and so far have not been heard of Burns remained insensible in the Salford dispensary up to the time of his death. At the inquest his wife told a long and pitiful tale of the persecution and fear under which her husband, who had at one-time been a unionist, had laboured since he commenced to work during the present bricklayers and masons’ strike in Manchester. A policeman had told her husband that he had been asked to keep out of the way whilst some of the union men gave him a good hiding. Deceased had also told her that a man had come to him whilst at work, and informed him that the society had paid men to disable him the first opportunity that night. The inquest was adjourned for a week. A large number of the spectators of the outrage have been summoned by the police to attend the proceedings. ______________________ A PRECIOUS RASCAL. —On Thursday, at Hartlepool, a man named Powter, who earned some notoriety last June, by eloping with the wife of another mechanic, leaving his own wife and children as a legacy to the parish authorities, was charged with assaulting his wife.

Scarcely had he arrived there before he left the house to renew his connection with his former paramour, to whose residence he was followed by his wife, and on her arrival he assaulted her.

LOVERING, AND OTHERS. —This was an action for breaking and entering the plaintiff's shop and carrying away his goods, tried in the Court of Exchequer on Thursday. —The plaintiff carried on the business of a draper in Chapel-street, Somerstown, and the defendants were Messrs. Lovering and Minton, accountants, Gresham-street, and two other persons, named Quinn and Lambert. In October last, while the plaintiff was absent, his premises were entered and the whole of his goods carried away in two or three vans. He ascertained that the illegal act had been committed at the instance of Messrs. Lovering and Minton, who had been employed by Messrs. Ponsford and Southall, woollen merchants, in Cannon-street, to try and get 30l. which the plaintiff owed them. The circumstances appeared to be these. Rowe, a servant of Ponsford and Southall, consulted Lovering as to the means of procuring the money, and the result was that Rowe, and Quinn and Lambert, two employés of the accountants, went to the plaintiff's shop, and not finding him there, and not being able to get payment, swept away the property in the manner described. They were first traced to the accountants' offices, and next to an auctioneer's warehouse in Little Britain, where they still remained. The plaintiff had been proceeded against in bankruptcy by some of his creditors, but the adjudication had been set aside with costs. —Mr. Digby Seymour offered on the parts of the defendants to return the goods and give some compensation to plaintiff for what he admitted was an illegal proceeding. —Mr. Serjeant O'Brien agreed to accept the goods, but required substantial damages. The parties, however, were unable to agree on the amount, and the trial proceeded. —The defence was that Lovering merely told Quinn and Lambert to try and get the money or the goods, and did not request them to take away the property by force in the event of not obtaining the money, and that in doing so they acted contrary to his instructions. To show that this was the fact evidence was given that on the goods being brought to his office he refused to take them in, although he had plenty of room for the purpose, and directed that they should be taken elsewhere. On the one side it was said the goods were worth from 500l. to 700l.; on the other only worth 150l. or 180l. —Mr. Baron Bramwell, in summing up, said that he never heard such an outrageous case in the whole course of his life, and he could scarcely conceive that such a thing could occur in this commercial community. There was no evidence against Minton, and a verdict would be given in his favour; but there must be a verdict against Quinn and Lambert. As to Lovering, they would have to say whether he was responsible for the act in question. It certainly seemed inconceivable that a sensible man of business should order Quinn and Lambert to remove the goods by force if they could not get the money. With respect to the damages, he said they should give damages for the outrage that had been committed as well as for the value of the goods. —The jury retired to consider their verdict.

The official representatives of the people in Parliament had approved of the foreign policy of the Government, but whatever the people thought now the day would come when the nation at large would speak out, and it would be no distant day when Lord Granville and Mr. Gladstone would be called back to power. The meeting by resolution rejoiced that the peace concluded at Berlin brought to an end one of the most destructive wars on record, but deplored the policy of menace and military preparation adopted by our own Government before going into the Congress. The meeting desired also to record its solemn protest against the wars in Afghanistan and in South Africa, as utterly incapable of justification on any principle of justice or humanity. The last resolution passed by the meeting was as follows: --“That this meeting approves the course taken by the committee of the Peace society in sending a deputation to Berlin, to bring the question of arbitration before the Congress of the Great Powers, assembled in that city to negotiate the terms of peace; and while rejoicing that the principle embodied in the Protocol of Paris of 1856 has been re-affirmed, regrets that some further steps were not taken by that august body to recognise in a more distinct and authoritative form the duty of civilized nations to have recourse to peaceable means of settling their disputes, instead of appealing to the sword.""","I THE PEAOE SOCIETY.

She admitted that she had had two children previously by a person named Leigh, but she denied that he was the father of the third. –The magistrate made an order on the defendant to pay 3s. 6d. per week until the child had attained the age of 16.

James Bloxham, of the White Horse, High-street, Popular, appealed against a conviction by Mr. Lushington, the magistrate at the Thames police-court, adjudging him to pay a fine of 4. and costs, and to have his licence endorsed, for unlawfully selling intoxicating liquor to a drunken man. The police evidence was to the effect that they saw two drunken men enter the appellant's house, and he served one of them with some ale. The appellant was called, and stated that on the day in question two men, named Smith and Crawley, wanted to be served, but as Smith was intoxicated he refused to let them have any liquor. Crawley was sober, and having expressed a wish to see Smith home, the appellant at length consented to serve him with a pint of fourpenny ale, upon condition that he would not allow Smith to drink any of it. While Crawley was consuming the liquor the police entered the house and said the landlord would be summoned.—Witnesses having been called to support the appellant's statement, the court unanimously quashed the conviction.",0.166206,0.476578,0.005874,0.038697
3206251456,"MURDER AND SUICIDE AT CHATHAM. On Monday, at the Prince of Guinea tavern, Pier-road, Gillingham, inquests were held by Mr. W. G. Harris, coroner, upon the bodies of John T. Osborne, retired wheelwright and cab proprietor, aged 62 years, and Mary Elizabeth Brenchley, aged 38, who had been living with the former as his wife. No one saw the fatal injuries inflicted, but it appeared that the parties had been quarrelling on Friday, the 13th inst. What followed after an alarm was raised may be gathered from the following evidence: –John Robert Osborne, smith and house agent, stated: Deceased, John Thomas Osborne, was my uncle, and aged 62. On Friday evening at about seven o'clock, in consequence of what I heard I went to his house in company with Constable M'Farren. In the kitchen we saw Miss Brenchley coming towards us. She had something wrapped round her neck. She pulled it aside, and said, ""Look here."" She was covered in blood, and we got her to a sofa, and called in two women. I asked where was Mr. Osborne, and she replied, ""I don't know."" I went upstairs, and there saw Mr. Osborne with his throat cut and blood oozing from the wound. He was dead upon the floor. There were no signs of a struggle, and I have no doubt whatever it was his own act. I next went into the back bedroom and there saw the signs of a most desperate struggle. We then returned downstairs and did what we could for the woman. I said, ""Who did this?"" She replied, ""I can't be bothered,"" and motioned me to keep back. Miss Brenchley told others, ""Osborne did it."" –Constable McFarren gave similar evidence, and Eliza Elliott and Maria Whitingham also stated that the deceased woman had mentioned Osborne as the man who had wounded her. Doctors Buzzard and Hugo described the injuries to both the deceased, leaving no doubt that Osborne had been the assailant, and that he had subsequently committed suicide. It was also stated that Osborne was very much depressed previous to the tragedy. The coroner, in summing up, read two letters written by Osborne, apparently just before the deed was committed. They contained statements of a very rambling nature, setting forth that the woman had been poisoning him and his child; that she had been unfaithful to him, and had been, his ruin, for which he intended paying her out. The jury ultimately returned a verdict to the effect that ""Osborne had murdered the woman, and had also committed suicide, whilst of unsound mind.""","I MURDER AND SUICIDE AT CHATHAMI On Alonday, at the Prince of Guinea tavern, Pier. road, Gillinsgham, inquests were held by Mr. W.

On searching the body a couple of keys, a purse containing 1s. 5½d., and other articles were found upon him together with pieces of paper with several addresses written upon them, but inquiring at these addresses witness could get no information concerning the deceased, as he was not known. Deceased was last seen alive on Saturday night, when he was in company with the man Dagenkolb at a club in Tottenham-court-road, and as he did not come home on Sunday his landlord reported the fact to the police, and he was circulated as missing.—By the Coroner: He understood that the deceased came to London in search of employment. His parents resided at 48, Garard Doustraat, Amsterdam.—Dr. W. A. Fitz-Rayne stated that he examined the body, and found the skull fractured. Death was certainly not due to drowning, as there was no water in the stomach. He was positive that when deceased received the injury to the head he was alive.—The coroner said he should adjourn the caso.—A. Juror: I think an eye should be kept upon the man Dagenkolb in the meantime.—The Coroner: The police will take all the necessary steps you suggest.",0.029726,0.145205,0.009289,0.052055

The writer denies that he had anything to do with the death of Mr. Rose, and says he has no intention of giving himself up. __________________________ SUPPOSED TRIPLE INFANTICIDE—At an inquest held at Newport (Mon.) on Tuesday shocking disclosures were made of supposed infanticide in Cross-street, one of the slums of the town. A young woman named Cantwell, employed at a flour stores, was shown to be the mother of three infants, who had all been beaten to death by blows on the temple and the remains concealed in a box kept under her bed in the room where she slept with another sister. The sister declared that she had no suspicion of what was happening. At first the detectives went to the house and accused the young woman, and going upstairs took the remains of one baby, a month dead, from the box. Several hours afterwards the police were induced to pay another visit, and on examining the box found the bodies of two more infants. The medical evidence was that both had been in the box some time, perhaps years, but the one was of greater age than the other. The nose and lips were flattened in each case as though from heavy blows, which fractured the front part of the skull. The coroner decided to adjourn the inquest for the attendance of the brothers, who had kept the house since the death of the mother.

3206277691,"ATTEMPTED MURDER AT A CLUB On Thursday considerable excitement was caused throughout the neighbourhood of Pentonville, when it became known that a desperate attempt to murder had been made on the premises of the North London club, 10, Rodney-street, Pentonville, and that the would-be murderer had eluded the vigilance of the police. It appears that during the afternoon the steward of the club received a post-card making an appointment which he went to keep, leaving Harry Karnes, aged 14, in charge, and that a short time after he had left a middle-aged man, known to Karnes as a frequenter of the place, entered and asked where the steward was. On the lad telling him that he had gone out the man threatened him, and, taking up a hammer, he began beating him about the head and body, felling him to the ground. The lad's screams for assistance aroused the attention of some persons living opposite, who, hastening to the premises, found Karnes lying in a pool of blood, with severe injuries to the head. A search showed that the would be murderer had made his escape. The injured boy was at once placed in a cab, and conveyed to the Royal Free hospital, Gray's Inn-road, and, on being examined by Dr. Fergusson, it was found that he had received several severe wounds on the head and was suffering from concussion of the brain.

MURDER BY A SOLDIER OF THE SLIGO RIFLES, –Saturday last, considerable excitement prevailed in Sligo in consequence of the discovery that a private of the Sligo rifles, named William Ferns, had inflicted frightful injuries on the head and person of an unfortunate girl named Ann Commons, which resulted in her death. The deceased and the prisoner, who is a native of Ballymote, were walking in the plantation, and a quarrel having taken place between them, the prisoner attacked the wretched girl in a savage manner, and inflicted frightful wounds upon her face and head with large stones, which were afterwards found on the spot by the police, covered with blood. Ferns was formerly an inmate of the Ballinasloe lunatic asylum; and it is stated that insanity will form the ground of his defence at the assizes. The prisoner made a statement to the following effect: – “I was irritated because she took a stone in her hand, with which she struck me on the finger, and a person being out of their mind, when they are irritated, they are worse than at other times. I was two years out of my mind in Sligo gaol and Ballinasloe. I had no stone at the time the witness said I had.” –A coroner’s jury have returned a verdict of wilful murder.

3206311495,"DARING ROBBERY AT A CHURCH. On Monday morning, at an early hour, it was discovered that a most daring robbery had been committed in the vestry-room of the parish church of St. Giles- without, Cripplegate, by some expert thieves. Late in the evening before (Sunday), the potman of Mr. Wiltshire, whose establishment adjoins the yard of the church at the back, nearly contiguous to the window of the vestry room, heard something like a tapping at a pane of glass, and a sudden rustling as he passed his master’s back door, before the hour of closing. Not taking any further notice of this circumstance, however, he made fast the back entrance, and with the family retired to rest. On Monday morning when he took down the back shutters, he found the vestry window in the churchyard broken, and the lattice-work torn from its place. He immediately informed his master, who sent for the churchwarden, Mr. John Scholes, of the White Horse, Cripplegate, who having instantly proceeded to inspect the premises, with the sexton, Mr. Johns, found that the vestry bad been entered, and the master key of the iron safes abstracted from its usual place of keeping. The thief or thieves had evidently entered by the opening in the window, which they had caused by a most ingenious cutting away of the glass. They had apparently carefully examined the safe and its contents, and succeeded in taking away the whole of the gold and silver there deposited, which, however, in consequence of the heavy Clearance of the amount of the former week's accumulation, was not a very considerable sum. Several of the drawers in the vestry-room had been “prised,” or forced with a lever, the marks of such an application of power being unmistakably evident. The thieves having been defeated in obtaining any important amount of plunder, then forced the door from the vestry leading into the church, and apparently attempted to force the contribution-box and the plate-chest, which resisted their efforts; for though the fastenings are violated, the contents remain secure. Being thus foiled, it appears that they then opened the closet containing the “tent,” “or sacramental” wine. This, it appears, was not according to their palate, as they left the bottle upon the floor, and the glass they had used, partially filled, standing beside it, but a small portion having been used from the bottle. The closet containing the best wine was not touched, nor were some pounds in money in the sexton’s drawer. The fellows having regaled themselves, left the vestry in a state of confusion, leaving behind them the bags which contained the money they had stolen, and the iron safes open. It is supposed that they obtained admission on Sunday evening to the churchyard, where one or more of them secreted themselves, and that, awaiting their opportunity, they effected the robbery about midnight, and subsequently decamped by the vicarage-house, which at the present time is not inhabited.","| DARING ROBB RY AT A CHURCH.

On Monday morning, at an early hour, it was discovered that a most daring robbery had been committed in the vestry-room of the parish church of St. Giles without, Cripplegate, by some expert thieves. Late in the evening before (Sunday), the potman of Mr. Wiltshire, whose establishment adjoins the yard of the church at the back, nearly contigsous to the window of the vestry-room, heard something like a tapping at a pane of glass, and a sudden rustling as he passed his master's back door, before the hour of closing. Not taking any further notice of this circumstance, however, he made fast the back entrance, and with the family retired to rest. On Monday morning when he took down the back shutters, he found the vestry window in the churchyard broken, and the lattice-work torn from its place. He immediately informed his master, who sent for the churchwarden, Mr. John Scholes, of the White Horse, Cripplegate, who having instantly proceeded to inspect the premises, with the sexton, Mr. Johns, found that the vestry had been entered, and the master key of the iron safes abstracted from its usual place of keeping. The thief or thieves had evidently entered by the opening in the window, which they had caused by a most ingenious cutting away of the glass. They had apparently carefully examined the safe and its contents, and succeeded in taking away the whole of the gold and silver there deposited, which, however, in consequence of the heavy clearance of the amount of the former week's accumulation, was not a very considerable sum. Several of the drawers in the vestry-room had been ""prised,"" or forced with a lever, the marks of such an application of power being unmistakably evident. The thieves having been defeated in obtaining any important amount of plunder, then forced the door from the vestry leading into the church, and apparently attempted to force the contribution-box and the plate-chest, which resisted their efforts; for though the fastenings are violated, the contents remain secure. Being thus foiled, it appears that they then opened the closet containing the ""tent,"" or ""sacramental"" wine. This, it appears, was not according to their palate, as they left the bottle upon the floor, and the glass they had used, partially filled, standing beside it, but a small portion having been used from the bottle. The closet containing the best wine was not touched, nor were some pounds in money in the sexton's drawer. The fellows having regaled themselves, left the vestry in a state of confusion, leaving behind them the bags which contained the money they had stolen, and the iron safes open. It is supposed that they obtained admission on Sunday evening to the churchyard, where one or more of them secreted themselves, and that, awaiting their opportunity, they effected the robbery about midnight, and subsequently decamped by the vicarage-house, which at the present time is not inhabited.",0.024729,0.140244,0.004743,0.024390

3206312608,"MURDER AT PORTSMOUTH. A very shocking occurrence took place late on Friday, the 22nd Feb., at No. 15, Kettering-place, Mile-end-road, Portsmouth. The person whose life has on this occasion been destroyed, was Amelia Ansell, wife of William Ansell, a steward in the navy, and recently returned to this country in the Albion, 90, on board which ship he was captain’s steward. Ansell and the deceased had been out together on Friday afternoon, and she returned home earlier than he did. Between ten and eleven o’clock a next-door neighbour heard Ansell and his wife quarrelling, and, soon after, the report of firearms. Some persons thereon went into the house and found the unfortunate woman lying on the floor quite senseless, and bleeding profusely from the temple. Medical assistance was immediately procured, but death ensued in about an hour. The police being informed of the tragedy, at once took Ansell into custody. The latter told the constable that it was an accident. He happened to have the pistol in his hand, and his wife touched the cock. He did not know at the time whether it was cocked or not, and that when it went off he was so overwhelmed that he did not hear the report. When he recovered himself he saw the blood gushing from her temple, and he put out his arms and said, “Amelia, what have I done?” He ran down stairs, he said, to send for medical aid. The ball entered just above the left temple, and lodged between the right jaw bone and the right ear. But there were some of the fingers of the left hand shot away, as though the hand had been raised to protect the temple. On Monday, the prisoner was examined before the borough magistrates. The chief evidence bearing against the prisoner was that of the neighbours in the two houses adjoining his residence in Kettering-street, Mile-end-road, Landport. The houses in this street are separated from each other merely by partitions of wood and plaster, and it appears that the residents of the houses adjoining the prisoner’s heard distinctly a quarrel between him and his wife, and ultimately the exclamation from the latter, “Help, murder! oh, give me time to make my peace.” Immediately after, the report of firearms was heard. The neighbours, ongoing into the house, secured the prisoner, and then sent for medical assistance, but it did not avail even to prolong life. The police found a six-barrelled Colt’s revolver in the house, five barrels of which were loaded and the other empty. The only cause that can be assigned for the committal of the act is a belief on the part of the prisoner of his wife's infidelity. He was committed for trial at the Winchester assizes. He evinced the deepest emotion in court","MURDER AT PORTSMOUTH. A very shocking occurrence took place late on Fd- day, the 22nd Feb., at No. 15, Kettering-place, Mile- end-road, Portsmouth.

3206316971,"THE RIGHT TO HOLD A FAIR. At the Lambeth police-court, Mr. William Wale, the proprietor of the Manor-house tavern and extensive grounds opposite Manor-place, Walworth, and close to the Royal Surrey-gardens, appeared to a summons, taken out by direction of the commissioners of police, charging him with having allowed a fair to be held on a piece of ground of which he was the occupier, without lawful authority. Mr. Lund, superintendent of police, stated that on the morning of the 17th he visited the gardens behind the defendant's house, and saw them fitted up in all particulars resembling a fair, with the exception of the absence of wild beasts. There was a rifle and shooting gallery, two swings, four gingerbread stalls, one wheel of fortune, three wheels for games of chance, a platform for dancing dogs, a show for the performance of canary birds, a tight rope for dancing, a booth called the gallery of illustration, and a weighing and lifting machine. He sent for Mr. Wale, and told him he was acting in violation of the law and amenable to act of parliament, as the place was a fair to all intents and purposes. Mr. Wale replied that it was only a ""fancy fair,"" but he (Mr. Lund) advised him to clear the ground, for that a number of his neighbours would be very much annoyed at it. The defendant replied that he could not do so, and witness then gave directions to the inspector and Sergeant Coppin to keep an eye on it, and he (Mr. Lund) himself had visited it on the different days. On one occasion, seeing 200 children there under sixteen years of age, he sent for Mr. Wale to speak to him, but he refused to come to him, and the message he sent to him was that if he wished to see him he must come to him. Besides the charge for admission, additional charges were made for some of the exhibitions on the ground. For the canary birds an addition was made. The charge for admission for the first day was one shilling, and the other day’s sixpence, but orders were given for admission. Mr. Child, who appeared for the defendant, contended that the entertainments on the grounds did not constitute a fair, and that summonses might with equal propriety be taken against the proprietors of the Crystal Palace. Mr. Elliott (the magistrate) said that there was no ground for considering the place a fair. Under the provisions of the Police Act the 2nd and 3rd Vic., cap. 47, a fair was a place for the purchase and sale of merchandise, and where a toll was charged, and therefore there was no pretence to call the exhibition described as a fair. If it was held to be so there would be an end to all sorts of amusements, and the summons against the defendant in this case was dismissed. Considerable applause followed the decision of his worship, and on its subsiding a gentleman, who represented himself as an inhabitant of the neighbourhood, rose, and representing the place as a most intolerable nuisance, entreated his worship's assistance on his own behalf and on that of his neighbours, to put a stop to or, at least, abate it. Mr. Elliott replied that all places of amusement must be more or less an annoyance to people in their immediate vicinity; but if the defendant, as a publican, had been guilty of any violation of his licence, he was amenable for it. His (Mr. Elliott's) judgment only went this, that in his opinion the defendant had not violated the act of parliament under which the proceedings had been taken.","THE RIGHT TO HOLD A FAIR.,At the Lambeth police-court, Mr. William Wale, the proprietor of the Manor-house tavern and extensive grounds opposite Manor-place, Walworth, and close to the Royal Surrey-gardens, appeared to a summons, taken out by direction of the commissioners of police, charging him with having allowed a fair to be held on a piece of ground of which he was the occupier, without lawful authority.

Considerable applause followed the decision of his worship, and on its subsiding a gentleman, who represented himself as an inhabitant of the neighbourhood, rose, and representing the place as a most intolerable nuisance, entreated his worship's assistance on his own behalf and on that of his neighbours, to put a stop to or, at least, abate it. Mr. Elliott replied that all places of amusement must be more or less an annoyance to people in their immediate vicinity; but if the defendant, as a publican, had been guilty of any violation of his licence, he was amenable for it. His (Mr. Elliott's) judgment only went to this, that in his opinion the defendant had not violated the act of parliament under which the proceedings had been taken.",0.002910,0.014682,0.001164,0.003263

The facts of the case were these: --The plaintiff was a milliner, assisting her brother, and the defendant, who was aged 29, was the son of a baker, of Stoke's croft. In June, 1868, the plaintiff replied to an advertisement in one of the local papers for a shop woman; but no notice was taken of her application till January, 1869, when the defendant's father called on the plaintiff and said he was the person who had advertised, and asked her if she was still open to take the situation. She said ""Yes,"" and terms being agreed upon, the plaintiff entered upon the situation. After she had been there two or three months, the defendant began to pay her considerable attention, and in March of 1869 he proposed marriage. She told him she must consult her mother, and having done so, she accepted him as her future husband, and it was arranged that they should be married in the spring of 1870. Matters went on smoothly; plaintiff was received kindly at defendant's house by his father and mother and other members of the family, and was looked upon as a future daughter and sister. Defendant some time ago went to America, and in June, 1869, he returned there in the hope of improving his position and providing a suitable home for the plaintiff. He stayed there from June, 1869, to May, 1871, and during the whole of that time he wrote regularly to the plaintiff. Ultimately, just before Christmas, 1872, defendant came home, and plaintiff saw him at his father's house, but there was an evident reticence and reserve on his part. He was anxious to avoid her, but she wrote to him, and he replied that he was not in a position to think of getting married. She thereupon wrote to him a long letter reviewing all the circumstances, and ending with this postscript: --""Stephen, I now ask you as a man, setting aside all that has occurred, and the obstacles you yourself have raised, are you prepared, within a reasonable time, to fulfil your engagement to me?

At the Monmouth assizes, on Thursday, James Henry Gibbs, a native of Richmond, was charged with the wilful murder of his wife, Mary Ann Gibbs, at St. Melons, Cardiff, in May last. From the opening statement of Mr. Brown, it appeared that the prisoner and the deceased (whose maiden name was Ingram) were in service together in 1871, and when prisoner removed to Llanrumney hall the acquaintance was renewed. On 30th January last they were married at St. Helier’s, Jersey. While at Llanrumney, however, prisoner had formed an intimacy with Miss Mary Jones, and while on his way to be married he wrote to her in most endearing terms. Deceased returned with the prisoner, who took apartments for her at Cardiff. He endeavoured to hide the fact of his marriage from Miss Jones, while to his wife he denied any intimacy with the latter. On the 12th May prisoner met his wife by appointment, and this was the last time she was seen alive. On the 3rd June her body was found in a ditch in an advanced stage of decomposition. Circumstances. came to light which implicated prisoner as the murderer, and he was apprehended. He said nothing in. answer to the charge, but his conduct strongly indicated mental torture, and the fact of his washing stained clothes in benzoline, and his conduct after his wife's death, corroborated the suspicions already entertained. The case for the prosecution was not closed when the Court rose. On Friday an umbrella, which had been found in the prisoner's pantry, was identified by a niece of the deceased as one that she had sold to her. Medical evidence was also given from which it appeared that the body at the time it was found had been saturated with blood, and that the bones of the rock had been severed by decomposition. The doctor gave it as his opinion that death had resulted from hemorrhage, produced by the throat having been cut, saying that in no other way could he account for the excessive flow of blood, though he admitted in cross-examination that aneurism of a large artery would produce great bleeding. —A Mr. Lougher was then called, and he proved that he had subjected the clothes of the prisoner to a severe chemical analysis, and that by that means and the aid of a microscope he had discovered stains on the coat, which bore distinct traces of blood, and which had evidently been the subject of much washing. There were a good many other stains, with regard to which he could not speak so positively. This finished the case for the prosecution. As its conclusion Mr. Brown, shortly summed up the facts, and Mr. Sawyer then addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner. —The jury, after 20 minutes' deliberation, returned a verdict of ""Guilty."" —His lordship then passed sentence of death in the usual form, adding that he could hold out no hope of mercy, and the prisoner was then removed, sobbing bitterly.","I BXTRAORDINARY TRIAL FOR MURDER I .t - the Monmouth assizes, on Thursday, Jaens fenasvy Gibb, a native of Richmond, was charged with the wilful murder of his wife, Mary Ann Gibbs, at St. Melons, Cardiff, in May last.

On the 12th May prisoner met his wife by appointment, and this was the last time she was seen alive. On the 3rd June her body was found in a ditch in an advanced stage of decomposition. Circumstances came to Light which implicated prisoner as the murderer, and he was apprehended. He said nothing in answer to the charge, but his conduct strongly indicated mental torture, and the fact of his washing stained clothes in benzoline, and his conduct after his wife's death, corroborated the suspicions already entertained. The case for the prosecution was not closed when the Court rose. On Friday an umbrella, which had been found in the prisoner's pantry, was identified by a niece of the deceased as one that she had sold to her. Medical evidence was also given from which it appeared that the body at the time it was found had been saturated with blood, and that the bones of the neck had been severed by decomposition. The doctor gave it as his opinion that death had resulted from hemorrhage, produced by the throat having been cut, saying that in no other way could he account for the excessive flow of blood, though he admitted in cross-examination that aneurysm of a large artery would produce great bleeding. — A Mr. Lougher was then called, and he proved that he had subjected the clothes of the prisoner to a severe chemical analysis, and that by that means and the aid of a microscope he had discovered stains on the coat, which bore distinct traces of blood, and which had evidently been the subject of much washing. There were a good many other stains, with regard to which he could not speak so positively. This finished the case for the prosecution. As its conclusion Mr. Brown shortly summed up the facts, and Mr. Sawyer then addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner. — The jury, after 20 minutes' deliberation, returned a verdict of ""Guilty."" — His lordship then passed sentence of death in the usual form, adding that he could hold out no hope of mercy, and the prisoner was then removed, sobbing bitterly.",0.053615,0.251984,0.004497,0.029762
3206322590,"POLICE INTELLIGENCE. MANSION HOUSE. A MYSTERY. –In the case of Mr. William. Cruikshank and Mr. Walter John Turner, who attended before the Lord Mayor on Tuesday upon a criminal information and summons, the reason of which did not publicly transpire, Mr. Kemp, barrister, addressing the Court, said before the matter was opened on the part of the prosecution he had an application to make. He represented the defendants, who were gentlemen of respectability, and this charge, as he believed, had been made against them to enforce the payment of debts, while civil proceedings, with the same object, were still pending and unsettled. Upon a charge of that nature the defendants' mouths were closed, but in the civil proceeding they would have full opportunity of giving their own explanation of the matter in dispute. He did not wish to refer to the information upon which the summonses had been granted, except to state that the defendants were ready and anxious to explain everything alleged against them–and that most satisfactorily. Looking to the fact that these civil proceedings were still pending, and that in a short time the defendants would be able to give their version of the circumstances upon oath, and to show that they had acted with good faith, honour, and integrity, he asked the Court to sanction such a reasonable adjournment of this criminal information as the case would justify. Mr. Besley assented to the proposal for an adjournment on the part of the prosecution. –The Lord Mayor said as both sides desired a postponement of the case, he would grant it, though if the facts stated. In the information were true, it was not a matter for private settlement or compromise. He adjourned the hearing of the summons until Feb. 17, and admitted the defendants to bail in the meantime, each. In the sum of 1,000l. GUILDHALL. A RUFFIAN. —Samuel Jackson, a chimney-sweep, of 9, Blue Hart-court, Little Bell-alley, was summoned for assaulting Eliza Stewart. The complainant said that she had lived with the defendant for five years as his wife. He had brutally ill-treated her and she had left him three times. He first seduced her under the promise of marriage, and every time she left him he induced her to go back again under a promise of marriage. On Monday last, after knocking her down, he threw her and her infant in arms out of doors, and she had since lived upon what the neighbours had given her. Some time ago he knocked her down and struck her on the side of the head just after she had been confined. She felt the effects of the assault even now. Mr. Pratt, who defended the case, said he would not cross-examine the witness if he could help it, as it would only embitter the feelings of the parties. He would suggest that the defendant, instead of going into the grievances he had against the complainant, should agree to allow her 10s. per week. —Sir Thomas Dakin thought that was not sufficient for a woman and three children. Two of the children were entitled to 5s. a week and one to 2s. 6d., and the woman ought to have something for herself. Eventually the defendant offered to pay 12s. 6d. a week and tendered a sovereign. Sir Thomas Dakin consented to an adjournment, but ordered the whole sovereign to be given to the complainant for her immediate wants. MARLBOROUGH-STREET.

She got the prisoner out, and missed her gold watch, which she had safe at the time.

He went after the prisoner, and told him he had got the watch, and the prisoner said, ""Is it yours?” He replied, ""No, Mrs. Mendoza's."" The prisoner went away, and he afterwards saw the prisoner at the station. —Police-constable Frith, 14 C R, said on his way to the station, the prisoner, who had been drinking, said it was the first time. –In reply to Mr. Newton, the constable said the prosecutrix was very excited. —Inspector Hamblin said he understood there was a tremendous row in the place. –The prosecutrix wished to state that persons, thieves and prostitutes, came nightly to the place about the same hour, for the purpose of making a disturbance, and accused her of selling liquors and having robberies there. –Mr. Newton: When you were summoned before me by the police you promised that you would give up the place. –The prosecutrix said she intended to do so. —Mr. Newton: The sooner the better. Shut the place up at once. You shall not keep a place which, according to your own showing, is the resort of thieves and prostitutes. –The prisoner was committed for trial. —Subsequently Mr. E Lewis, of Marlborough-street, attended, having been unavoidably absent, and asked that the prisoner might be remanded, stating that the prisoner was well connected, and had means of his own, and that it was incredible that a person in his position should have been guilty of such a robbery. —Mr. Newton declined to accept bail.","POLICE INTELLIGENCE.

Prisoner, before his arrest, was a clerk in the employ of Messrs. Lay and Wheeler, wine merchants, Colchester. He maintained a sullen demeanour. The evidence was in the main a repetition of that given at the coroner's inquest. Testimony as to the purchase of the revolver produced at the inquest by prisoner's brother Robert was forthcoming from George Dove, a lad employed at Mr. Boreham the gun maker's shop at Colchester. He said he knew prisoner very well by sight, but could not swear whether he was the person to whom witness sold on Tuesday, the 10th of August—the day after prisoner had written to deceased asking her to meet him on Sunday evening, August 15—a revolver, case, and box of cartridges. The revolver produced was exactly like that he sold. The cartridges produced were of the same kind as he sold with the revolver.

Lay and Wheeler, wine and spirit merchants, Colchester, prisoner late employers, said prisoner showed him a six chambered revolver and case on Saturday morning, August 14, the last day he was at work.

Witness could not swear to either revolver or case, but they looked just the same as those prisoners showed him. –The inquiry was adjourned.

George Dove, a lad in the employ of Mr. Boreham, of Colchester, proved the sale of a revolver on the 10th inst., and George Isom, a porter in the same employ as the prisoner, stated that the prisoner showed him a pistol on the day before the murder. Mr. William Hammond, farmer, of Brantham, spoke to hearing a quarrel between two persons near his house on the 8th inst., and to seeing the deceased go by shortly afterwards in the direction of her master's house.

3206327803,"FATAL DISASTER IN A MINE. On Wednesday night, when the men were about leaving their work at Tynewyd decolliery, situate in the Greater Rhondda valley, a roar of rushing water was heard. Many succeeded in making their escape to the surface. It was soon discovered, however that 14 men and boys were missing. Several volunteers descended the shaft, which is 92 yards deep, and entered the workings. While the explorers were consulting what action should be taken, faint knockings were heard on the other side of the coal, at a distance, it was conjectured, of a dozen yards. No sooner was this heard than a score of men with mandrils commenced cutting through the solid mass, and by the sound it was soon ascertained that the imprisoned persons, consisting of five firemen and a boy, among whom was Charles Morgan, were doing likewise. Relays of colliers, worked with great energy throughout the night, and about six o'clock on Thursday morning Charles Morgan's mandril struck through and made an opening. The next moment a terrific explosion, as that of a cannon, took place, but not of gas, and coal and rubbish were shot against those working to meet Morgan, and one man was terribly out about the face. A few moments later, on approaching the hole, it was discovered that Morgan had been jammed in it, and that he was dead. The inundation had been so sudden as to imprison the air in the inner workings, and the force of this had kept back the water from the five men. The moment a small hole was made by Morgan's mandril, this volume of imprisoned air collided with fatal result. Between eight and nine o'clock the poor fellow's dead body was brought to the surface with only his trousers, shirt, and boots on, as he had laboured through the night, struggling for the life of himself, his aged father, and two friends.

On Monday morning Thomas Pratt, 27 years of age, a bargeman, was executed within Newgate gaol for the murder of Elizabeth Frances Brockington, in Wilderness-row, St. Luke's, in September last. The prisoner professed strong love for the deceased, and this feeling was embittered by jealousy because of her refusal to live with him. So he resolved, he stated in his own way, that she should not become connected with any other. He did not in any way attempt to extenuate his act, and at the trial it was attempted to show that he was not in a responsible state of mind at! the time. The convict was a very ignorant man, what little education he had having been obtained at the Field-lane Ragged school, to which he had belonged, and in regard to religious duties he had entirely lapsed. He was attended by the Rev. Mr. Jones, the ordinary of Newgate, to whose ministrations he became attentive and resigned. The condemned man rose on Monday morning at six o'clock, when breakfast was provided, and the chaplain was soon afterwards in attendance, remaining with him till close upon eight o'clock, when Alderman and Sheriff Nottage, Mr. Undersheriff Crawford, the Governor of the gaol (Mr. Smith), and Marwood, the executioner, went to the cell.

While Marwood was performing the last grim offices prior to drawing the bolt, the convict gazed steadily upwards at the beam and dangling apparatus, as if it possessed a sort of ghastly fascination for him. The drop was six and a half feet, and the prisoner appeared to die instantly.

It proved to be ""oil of vitriol,"" and the boy lingered in much suffering through the night, and died of the effects about five o'clock the next morning. It is supposed that the bottle had been thrown out by a young man in Mr. Winder's employ, in mistake for a broken bottle. An inquest was held on view of the body, and the verdict was ""Accidental Death."" —Manchester Chronicle. A trial has recently taken place in Corsica for one of those frequent murders, the result of ancient fends, for which that country is so deplorably remarkable. The names of the prisoners were Marsilius Nicolai and Jacque Grigi The following was the substance of evidence against them"" On the 18th of April, 1833, J. Ferri, J. Lucioni, Nicodemus and Paul Automarchi, seized some sheep which were found trespassing upon the lands of the Automarchi, and which belonged to a family called Nicolai, with whom they had been for a long time a variance. As they were driving the sheep to the pound, they came about noon to a part of the road called Reposatajo, when they were suddenly as sailed by a shower of musket balls, aimed at then b seven or eight individuals, amongst whom were Marsilius Nicolai and Jacques Grigi. Ferri and Nicodemus Auto marchi were killed on the spot, and Luccioni, who receive two balls, one in the breast and the other in the right eye, expired a few hours after. Paul Automarchi, though severely wounded, succeeded in making his escape. Paul Automarchi deposed that he recognized Marsilius Nicolai amongst the assassins, and that it was he who fired at him. Other witnesses declared that, immediately before dying, Luccioni had affirmed that Marsilius Nicolai was one of the murderers.

An inquest was held on view of the body, and the verdict was ""Accidental Death.""—Manchester Chronicle. A trial has recently taken place in Corsica for one of those frequent murders, the result of ancient feuds, for which that country is so deplorably remarkable. The names of the prisoners were Marsilius Nicolai and Jacqueline Griji. The following was the substance of evidence against them:—“On the 18th of April, 1833, J. Ferri, J. Luccioni, Nicodemus and Paul Automarchi, seized some sheep which were found trespassing upon the lands of the Automarchi, and which belonged to a family called Nicolai, with whom they had been for a long time a variance. As they were driving the sheep to the pound, they came about noon to a part of the road called Reposatajo, when they were suddenly sailed by a shower of musket balls, aimed at them b seven or eight individuals, amongst whom were Marsili Nicolai and Jacques Grigi. Ferri and Nicodemus Auto marchi were killed on the spot, and Luccioni, who received two balls, one in the breast and the other in the right eye, expired a few hours after. Paul Automarchi, though severely wounded, succeeded in making his escape. Paul Automarchi deposed that he recognised Marsiliu Nicolai amongst the assassins, and that it was he who fired at him. Other witnesses declared that, immediately before dying, Luccioni had affirmed that Marsiliu Nicolai was one of the murderers. The next witness was John Baptist Luccioni, the father of one of the victims. Being asked by the President, at the desire of the prisoner, if he were not his enemy, he turned towards Nicolai, and, with the most impassioned gestures and tone of voice, thus addressed him, “O, Marsilius, you say I am your enemy, but are you not Marsilius?

Yesterday William Quantill, John Desforges, and John Spratley, a coachman, ostler, and post-boy, in the employ of Mr. Cullin, the landlord of the Castle tavern, Brentford, were charged with appropriating to their own use the sum of 30l. From the evidence produced, it appeared that, a few days since, Spratley was hired by a lady and gentleman who alighted at the Castle, from Williams's Reading coach, to drive them to Clapham. On his return he gave a 20l. note, No. 12,688, and a 10l., 14,420, to Quantill to take to London and get changed for sovereigns, saying he had found them in the chaise after he had put his fare down. Quantill, after his return, gave Spratley only £24, saying he should keep the other for his trouble. Spratley, not much pleased with his conduct, gave 21 sovereigns to the prisoner, Disforges, to keep for him, and on his asking him for them on Saturday, he refused to return him more than £14. Spratley accordingly applied to the magistrates on the same day for a summons against his fellow-prisoners. When the magistrates became acquainted with the above circumstances, they ordered all three to be taken into custody. The Driver of Williams's coach remembered bringing a lady and gentleman to the Castle, Brentford, but he did not know who they were, as they came to the coach in a post-chaise. Inspector Marchant informed the Bench, that he had that morning received a letter from the Inspector at Clapham, to whom he had written, stating that although he had used every endeavour, he had been unable to ascertain who the parties were whom the prisoner Spratley had driven in his chaise. The prisoners, having nothing to say, were remanded for reexamination. IMPORTANT TO LICENSED VICTUALLERS. Messrs. THOMAS HOLFORD and WILLIAM ENGLISH, the landlords of the Chequers and the Ball public-houses, at Isleworth, were each fined £5, and 12s. costs, for selling beer previous to their respective licences being transferred. The information’s were laid by a common informer, named John Thomas, whose witness, George Bowley, stated, that on the 20th of October last he went into the defendants' houses, in the first of which he was served with a pint of porter, and in the other with a pot. The licences of the houses were not transferred until the following day, the 21st ult.

3207644658,"SOUTH DEVON ELECTION. TO THE EDITOR OF THE MORNING CHRONICLE. Era—I yesterday recorded my vote at Kingsbridge in favour of Lord John Russell, and soon afterwards took my departure for London. From what I have seen and heard, I have no doubt but that the Tory candidate will prove successful. Throughout the county the walls were marked with ""No Russell,"" ""No Popery,"" and similar epithets; and bills, charging Lord John with almost everything that is evil, were extensively circulated. Reports were also afloat calculated to frighten the electors of South Devon, and induce them to believe that Lord John would establish Popery, with all its train of persecuting horrors; but this bugbear to frighten the good people of South Devon is nothing compared to the tyranny exercised by the Tory landholders and parish priests over their tenants and parishioners. It is notorious that multitudes of landlords gave their tenants the option of voting contrary to conscience, or the sacrifice of their families by quitting their estates. Hundreds, it is supposed, yielded to the claims of their families; and large numbers, known to be decided Liberals, voted for the Tory candidate to save their families from ruin. A farmer, with tears in his eyes, came to solicit my advice under these circumstances. I hesitated as to the advice I should give, when he paused, and then exclaimed in an agony of desperation,"" I am determined to do my duty, and await the consequences."" I could not but ad-mire his patriotism. Is it right that men and their families should be placed in this dilemma? I have ever been opposed to the ballot, but unless some other remedy can be found, from what the last few days have shown me, I am convinced of Its utility. I have seen flocks of poor tenants driven to the polling place like negro slaves to the market; the squire and parish priest in their carriages, leading; the poor tenants of the parish following; and livery servants bringing up the cavalcade, like whippers-in, to see that none escaped. Is this freedom of election? Can it be endured much longer? Either let the country be given up to the aristocracy and parsons, or protect the tenants from worse than slavery. I hope the defeat in Devon will produce a remedy for this horrible evil. —I am, Sir, yours respectfully, Eastcheap, May 5. R. PEEK.","SOUTH DE 'ON ELECTION.

To the EDITOR of the MORNING CHRONICLE. — I yesterday recorded my vote at Kingsbridge in favour of Lord John Russell, and soon afterwards took my departure for London. From what I have seen and heard, I have no doubt but that the Tory candidate will prove successful. Throughout the county the walls were marked with ""No Russell,"" ""No Popery,"" and similar epithets; and bills, charging Lord John with almost everything that is evil, were extensively circulated. Reports were also afloat calculated to frighten the electors of South Devon, and induce them to believe that Lord John would establish Popery, with all its train of persecuting horrors; but this bugbear to frighten the good people of South Devon is nothing compared to the tyranny exercised by the Tory landholders and parish priests over their tenants and parishioners. It is notorious that multitudes of landlords gave their tenants the option of voting contrary to conscience, or the sacrifice of their families by quitting their estates. Hundreds, it is supposed, yielded to the claims of their families; and large numbers, known to be decided Liberals, voted for the Tory candidate to save their families from ruin. A farmer, with tears in his eyes, came to solicit my advice under these circumstances. I hesitated as to the advice I should give, when he paused, and then exclaimed in an agony of desperation, ""I am determined to do my duty, and await the consequences."" I could not but admire his patriotism. Is it right that men and their families should be placed in this dilemma? I have ever been opposed to the ballot, but unless some other remedy can be found, from what the last few days have shown me, I am convinced of its utility.
